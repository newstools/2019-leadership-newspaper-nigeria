The Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed an Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) training camp and killed several terrorists at Malkonory in Northern Borno State. The director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola said the operation was executed on 10 February 2019, after Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft observed significant human activities with several structures, equipment and vehicles spotted camouflaged under the dense vegetation in the area used by the terrorists for training. He said that in a swift response, the ATF dispatched two Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet aircraft to attack the location, dropping their bombs successfully within the camp leading to massive fires and resulting in the neutralizing of several terrorists. He noted that the Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) by the NAF and allied ISR later revealed that the terrorists suffered heavy casualties as a result of the air strikes. He reiterated that the NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, would sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the Northeast.
