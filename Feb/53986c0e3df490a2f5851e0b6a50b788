In Nigeria, they say things never change. The more things change, the more they remain the same. Senate President Bukola Saraki is arguably fighting the toughest political battle of his life. The senate president in an anomaly doubles as the Director General of the Peoples Democratic Party presidential campaign. A similar situation played out in 2015 when the then Rivers State governor, Rotimi Amaechi was the director general of the Buhari camapaign, a similar role he is also playing now. Recall that Amaechi fell out with the Jonathan administration and was the number one villain of the administration and the South South region. A defeat then would have signalled the end of his political career. The same scenario is playing out again in the case of Saraki. The Senate President is also seeking to return to the Senate and do a David Mark and at the same time, he is working round the clock to ensure his candidate, Atiku Abubakar, wins the presidential election. A normally calm and composed Saraki is seen dancing at rallies. Saraki knows a defeat of Atiku in the election will also signal the end of his political career. Forget anything you read or hear, the senatorial election in Kwara will be a do-or-die affair. Both parties will throw caution to the wind; there is so much at stake in Kwara. The All Progressives Congress (APC) will want to teach Saraki a lesson, while the Senate president will want to prove he still holds the four aces in Kwara politics. At the end of the day, one of the candidates will be brutally bruised politically. A tough contest awaits us in Kwara you may say.
