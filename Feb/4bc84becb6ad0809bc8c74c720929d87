The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has raised the alarm over the circulation of fake United States Dollar notes ahead of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections. The commission also urged Bureaux de Change (BDC) operators to be cautious and not allow the infiltration of these fake dollars in their businesses. In a statement personally signed by the acting chairman of the commission, Ibrahim Magu, on Thursday, the agency stated that the warning follows intelligence gathered in the build-up to the elections. Part of the statement further read that “the intelligence indicates that the dollar notes have features of genuineness, but forensic analysis by the Commission reveals otherwise. “We, therefore, warn the BDC operators to be cautious in their transactions from now till the end of the elections.”
