A High Court sitting in Maiduguri yesterday sentenced a 19-year-old Islamic teacher, Sulaiman Abubakar of Ngomari costine area of Maiduguri, to 10 years imprisonment for defiling a minor. The convict who is a teacher at a private Islamic school in Ngomari costine area of Maiduguri, lured the victim, a pupil of the school, aged six years, to a staff room, after school hours and forcefully raped her. When the accused plea was entered by the prosecution, he pleaded guilty to the offence of rape. The prosecution had prior to the plea, said the offence which is a statutory rape, contravenes section 283 of the penal code laws of Borno State 1994 , noting that consent is immaterial in such offence. In his ruling, the trial judge, Justice Wakil Gana, sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment while describing the act as dastardly. Justice Wakil frowned at the increasing number of rape cases especially of minors among Islamic teachers in the state, hence he urged government and NGOs to beam their search light on such schools. The trial judge expressed sadness, noting that this was the fourth rape case he was adjudicating in recent times. Justice Gana recalled that the last convict for rape before this one, had 10 children and was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment for serially raping three girls between the ages of 6 to 7 years.
