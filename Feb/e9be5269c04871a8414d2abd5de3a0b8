Nigeria’s pension assets gained a whopping N1.11 trillion in the last 13 months, translating to about 12 per cent growth in total pension fund within this period, LEADERSHIP investigation has revealed. As at  31st December, 2017, the pension fund stood at N7.52 trillion but grew to N8.63 trillion as at the end of December, 2018, thereby, recording the best growth in the last 15 years of the existence of the new pension scheme. Between January and February, 2018, the pension assets gained N250 billion representing 2.8 per cent growth to close the second month of the year at N7.779 trillion. However, by March 2018, the fund rose to N7.94 trillion, as it grew by N170 billion to the figure posted in the preceding months, while in April, 2018, it grew by N150 billion to close the month at N8.09 trillion. By May, 2018, the total pension asset has risen to N8.14 trillion, up by N50 billion from the preceding month’s figure, even as it grew by N90 billion to end the month of June at N8.23 trillion. The pension assets further gained additional N90 billion in the month of July 2018, with another growth of N10 billion recorded in August, while by September 2018, the pension fund had risen to N8.34 billion, growing additional N10 billion in the process. There was a N110 billion increase in pension assets by October, 2018, shooting up the total fund to N8.45 trillion in that month, and in November, the fund soared by N40 billion, to end the month at N8.49 trillion. In December, 2018, the pension assets grew by N140 billion, the third highest within that period on a month-by-month analysis to end 2018 at N8.63 trillion. This consistent increase, findings show, was attributable to new pension contributions received, interest from fixed income securities and net realised on equities and mutual fund investments. Investment income, according to LEADERSHIP investigation, was instrumental to the continuous growth in pension funds, despite the fact that government at the state and federal levels are not paying the monthly pension contributions of their workers as and when due. The Pension Fund operators have, however, invested over N6.3 trillion, translating to about 70 per cent of the pension assets, into federal government securities. Acting director-general, National Pension Commission (PenCom), Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar, at the public hearing of the House of Representatives Ad-hoc Committee in Abuja recently, said, the total pension fund had an average monthly contribution of N29.15 billion, while the total pension assets were equivalent to 7.40 per cent of the Nigerian rebased Gross Domestic Product (GDP). She said the pool of pension funds generated by the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) had aided the deepening of Nigeria’s financial sector. The fund, the PenCom boss said, had also provided a platform for attaining strategic programmes of government in the areas of infrastructure, housing and the development of the real sector of the economy. She said the number of registered contributors grew to 8.41 million as of December 2018. According to her, this figure represents about 12.09 per cent of Nigeria’s working population and 4.29 per cent of total Nigeria population. The CPS, she said, had simplified the process of payment of retirement benefits through the issuance of effective regulations and guidelines for accessing such benefits. Dahir-Umar also disclosed that 260,808 persons had retired under the new pension scheme as of December 2018 and were currently receiving pensions as and when due with an average monthly pension payment of N10.18 billion.
