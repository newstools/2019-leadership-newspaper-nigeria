National and State Assembly candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State as well as their supporters have taken over the main entrance into the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) office in Port Harcourt.  The protesters, led by the candidate for Rivers South-East senatorial district and Nigeria’s Ambassador to Netherlands, Oji Ngofa are demanding that APC candidates be relisted on the ballot on line with orders of both the Appeal Court and the Supreme Court.  Although there is heavy presence of security men at the INEC office entrance, the protesters have refused to allow officials and visitors to the electoral body access into the office.  Carrying placards that read: “No APC, no election in Rivers State”, “INEC obey the Stay of Execution Order of the Appeal Court”, amongst others, the protesters are chanting war songs.  Addressing newsmen, Ngofa said they will not leave the INEC office until the electoral body obeys the order of the courts and relist the APC and all it’s candidates in the ballot.
