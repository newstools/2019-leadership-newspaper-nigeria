Troops of Sector 3, Operation Lafiya Dole, deployed in Mallam Fatori, on Thursday, February 7, 2019 at about 6am, killed several members of the Boko Haram Insurgents during a fire fight. The insurgents were lured from their hideout in Tumbun Gini with 10 gun trucks and motorcycles to a place very close to the defensive location of the troops. The deputy director, Army Public Relations, Sector 3, Col Ezindu Idimah, said that during the firefight that ensued, the insurgents were overpowered and several of them neutralised. He said some of the terrorists who tried to escape with three gun trucks to the Tumbus, were given hot pursuit and many more killed by the Nigeria Air force. The troops recovered an anti aircraft gun, AK 47 rifles, rocket propelled grenade tubes, bombs and chargers. Other items recovered include some quantities of 12.7 millimetre ammunitions, 7.62 millimetre ammunitions, magazines, links and Bandolier jackets. He said the feat is the second time within five days that troops of Sector 3 Operation Lafiya Dole dealt with the Boko Haram Insurgents. He noted that the first was on February 2, 2019 at the same location where the insurgents suffered heavy casualties. He urged the troop to continue to give their loyalty and commitment to the nation at all times.
