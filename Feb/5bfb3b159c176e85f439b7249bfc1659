The president of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, has significantly moved up in the World Billionaires’ list as he emerged 64th richest person in the world, with an estimated worth of $16.6 billion, as against his previous ranking of 103rd in the world. Dangote, who remains the richest man in Africa for the eight – year running, was the only Nigerian on the list of the top 500 billionaires, as released  by Bloomberg in its yearly billionaires list. Jeff Bezos remains the richest in the world with $136 billion in his kitty, while Bill Gates and Warren Buffett followed as 2nd and 3rd respectively with $98.4 billion and $83 billion on the world billionaires chart, which is dominated by North Americans. Dangote’s estimated worth in the latest Bloomberg ranking far outstrips an earlier ranking by the Forbes Magazine, another elite publication which placed his fortune at $10.8billion in the 2019 Forbes Africa’s Billionaires’ list released in January, although he retained the rank as the richest African for the eight consecutive year in the latter ranking. There are only five Africans on the Bloomberg list of the world’s top 500 billionaires, with Dangote topping the group. The other four Africans included Nicky Oppenheimer of South Africa,  Johann Rupert of South Africa, Natie Kash of South Africa and Naguib Sawiris of Egypt. Bloomberg is a global information and technology company, that connect decision makers to a dynamic network of data, people and ideas.
