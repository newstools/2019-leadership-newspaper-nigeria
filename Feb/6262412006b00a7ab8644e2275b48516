Governor Kashim Shettima yesterday, strengthened the fight against insurgency with the inauguration of 500 hunters/vigilantes to complement the efforts of the military and other security agencies in the country. Shettima said that the measure was necessitated by the renewed attacks in many parts of the state by Boko Haram terrorists. At an event held at the Government House, Maiduguri, the governor said that all the hunters who took an oath with the Holy Qu’ran and the Bible to defend the people would be deployed alongside troops in strategic places in Maiduguri metropolis and Jere local government areas to check the Boko Haram menace. He disclosed that each hunter would be placed on a monthly salary of N10,000, while their superiors would earn N20,000 per month. The governor donated 250 bags of rice (50kg) to cushion the hardship of the families of the hunters. While introducing the hunters before the governor, the attorney-general and commissioner for justice, Mr. Kaka Shehu Lawal, said: “A couple of months back, in one of the security meetings, we resolved to engage 500 hunters to complement the efforts of our security forces. “It is in view of our resolution that we present to you this set of gallant hunters for inauguration,” he said. The leader of the vigilantes, Mai Durma, who administered the oath with the Holy Qu’ran and the Bible to the hunters, admonished them to be good ambassadors of the state. He charged them to be mindful of the oath they had taken by refraining from revealing the modus operandi of the military operations to the insurgents. Durma alleo warned them against betraying the confidence the state government reposed in them in all their dealings, adding that they should do anything to jeopardise the relative peace in the state. “Anyone who reveals our strategy to Boko Haram terrorists or betrays the government course, may be consumed by this oath,” Durma warned.
