A former president of the Court of Appeal and chairman of Katsina State Senior Citizens Forum, Justice Mamman Nasir, yesterday rejected the endorsement of Atiku Abubakar by the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) for the 2019 presidential race, saying a faction of the forum cannot speak for the North on the right choice of candidate to lend its support.  The royal father sounded the warning in a statement jointly signed by him and the secretary of the Katsina State senior Citizens Forum, Aliyu Sani Mohammed.  In the statement entitled, ‘A Clarion Call For Free, Fair, Transparent and Credible Elections’, issued shortly after a meeting of the forum, Mohammed urged Nigerians to ignore the support purportedly drummed by a section of the Northern Elders Forum for the presidential candidate of the opposition  (PDP), Atiku Abubakar.  He said, “We stand by our earlier decision to endorse President Muhammadu Buhari and Right Hon. Aminu Bello Masari (under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for President and Governor of Katsina State in 2019 (elections). We are satisfied with the peace and unity they preach. The President and the Katsina State Governor are advocates of peace in the country and we should support them wholeheartedly.  “We call on all citizens of Katsina and Nigeria to avoid trouble and conduct themselves decently which we hope will lead to peaceful elections. Katsina State is well known for providing well known credible and responsible leaders since time immemorial and as such we should not fold our hands and allow crisis”.  The forum further advised politicians to play politics according to the rules, adding that “the political tension in the country should immediately be doused for peaceful campaign based on issues and devoid of blackmail which is capable of creating chaos.” It also resolved that Nigerians should desist from over-heating the polity and allow the electorate to decide who should be their leaders.
