The Federal High court sitting in Abuja has declared Alhaji Mohammed Sani Musa 313 as the winner of the Niger East APC Senatorial District primaries. In a landmark judgement, the court declared Musa winner of the October 2nd primaries having pulled the total votes of 39,192 votes as against Senator David Umaru’s votes of 5,870. The judge argued that the leadership of the All Progressives Congress acted in total disregard to logic, the constitution as well as the party guidelines to supplant Mohammed Sani Musa with David Umaru who scored votes of 5,870. She added that the days of party impunity is over and shall never be tolerated anymore. “The All Progressives Congress APC leadership acted in bad faith with total disregards for the electoral act, the constitution and party guidelines. Any act that negates party guidelines, the electoral act and the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria is an illegality and party impunity taken too far that cannot be tolerated. “
