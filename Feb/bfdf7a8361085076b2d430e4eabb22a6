Barely three days to the Presidential election, Igbo socio-political group, Ohaneze Ndigbo, and its Yoruba counterpart, Afenifere, on Wednesday endorsed President Muhammmadu Buhari for re-lection. Speaking at a world press conference in Lagos, the leaders of the two socio-political groups, who were joined by other coalition warned Nigerians to consider the future of the country while casting their vote on Saturday. The Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Uche Okwukwu who read the joint statement signed by Price Tajudeen Olusi on behalf of Afenifere , Chief Babafemi Ajayi of the Oodua Nationalist Coalition among others argued that every Nigerian must prevent return of the country into the hands of those they called  conservatives that allegedly ran its affairs between 1999 and 2015, widening gap between the rich and needy. While distancing themselves from the factions that previous endorsed presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, they alleged that the action of the other faction was motivated by pecuniary gains. Okwukwu said, “Nigeria should not return into the dark era of brigandage. We may be feeling some pains now, but we should not forget that every situation has its own primary and secondary causes.” He warned that rejecting the present administration would not translate to a new renaissance, but rather, roll back the gains recorded in railway, anti-graft war and integrity in culture of election. “In their struggle to capture power, they have largely invoked religion and ethnicity as instrument to help them consummate their evil plot. “We have to think of the greater future that lay ahead; we have to think of our children and the future that beckon on them. We have to think of humanity as a whole.’’ Olusi, who was represented by Comrade Ajayi Taiwo, argued that next Saturday’s election, stressed that every electorate must consider benefits the present administration has brought and the their future plans.
