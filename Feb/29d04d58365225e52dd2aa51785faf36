The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers state, Tonye Patrick Cole has saluted the ruling of the Court of Appeal ordering a stay of execution of the judgement of the federal High Court stopping the APC from fielding candidates in all elections in the state. Cole described the ruling as victory for the people of Rivers state while asking his supporters to be vigilant and know that the battle is not yet over. In a statement he personally signed and made available to The Nation in Abuja, Cole said they are making urgent arrangement to ensure that the Independent National Electoral Commission is served with the ruling. He said: “I just want to take a minute to thank the Almighty God for his grace upon us all. I know without Him, this would be totally impossible. We were up against it. We still are but our God who has been with us throughout this journey will see us to the end. “I want to spare a thought for the brave judges and the entire judiciary for simply standing firm on the side of justice. We have faith in you. To all our supporters and leaders in the APC, I want to say a big thank you for keeping the faith. The times have been tough – I know, but you have showed that with God, we are already winners. “To my Rivers people, fear not. Nothing good comes easy. This is but one giant step to the Promised Land. “We have taken immediate steps to serve INEC by tomorrow with the ruling which will see APC back on the ballot box in time for the elections.”
