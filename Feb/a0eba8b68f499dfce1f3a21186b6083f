Kaduna state governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, has earlier on Saturday voted at the polling unit after staying on queue for four hours, just as he commended voters for their peaceful conduct. Speaking to journalists shortly after casting his vote, El-rufai commended other voters for being orderly, calm and maintaining peace while casting their votes. The governor trekked back again from the polling unit, a stone throw to his private residence, in Ungwan Sarki area. El-Rufai, who voted at 1:20pm appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to extend the voting hours to 4pm to enable voters to vote. El-rufai, however, commended voters for turning out massively to cast their votes peacefully and orderly. Meanwhile, the late arrival of voting materials and malfunctioning of card readers marred the polls in some polling units, though the elections was peaceful without violent.
