Former Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Femi Bamisile, has said that huge votes await the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, President Muhammadu Buhari in the North. Bamisile said that the votes would be complemented by his supporters in the southern part of the country to make him win the presidential election on Saturday. He faulted claims by the opposition that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had taken over the North, describing it as empty. The APC House of Representatives candidate in Ekiti South federal constituency II, said yesterday, that the statement ascribed to the president on ballot box snatcher was a confirmation of the fact that the APC -led federal government and the leadership of the ruling party under Buhari is committed to free, fair and credible elections. Bamisile, who spoke with journalists in Ado Ekiti, predicted that Buhari and other candidates of the party would win in Ekiti by 80 per cent in the elections. He said: “The president didn’t give a shooting order the way former President Olusegun Obasanjo gave a shoot on sight order against the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) when he was president. “President Buhari only said that those who snatched ballot boxes will have themselves to blame. So, I stand hundred per cent behind him on this order. We are not in the 19th Century when things were absurd. It is a barbaric act for anyone to snatch ballot boxes,” Bamisile said.
