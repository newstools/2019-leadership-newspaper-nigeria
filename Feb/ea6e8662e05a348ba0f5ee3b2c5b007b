Special adviser to the president on Niger Delta, Prof Charles Dokubo, has said President Muhammadu Buhari would not leave the Niger Delta behind in his determination to transform the country. Speaking at a foundation laying ceremony for a vocational training centre of the Amnesty Programme at Gelegele, Edo State, he urged the people of Niger Delta to be united in pursuit of a common vision and support President Buhari for rapid development of the region through the instrumentality of the Amnesty Programme and other interventionist agencies. Dokubo, who stated this through his special assistant on Media, Murphy Ganagana, also stressed that the terminal date for the Presidential Amnesty Programme was not a card on President Muhammadu Buhari’s table. According to him, “Our people should know that they are all part of the Amnesty Programme, which was set up by the late President Yar’Adua, who brought the demands and aspirations of the Niger Delta people to the bear. He knew that for a long time, we had not gained from whatever was produced in the country. The ground-breaking ceremony for the Amnesty Programme Vocational Training Centre (VTU), Gelegele, preceded the commissioning of a vocation training centre at Kaiama, Bayelsa State, which was completed, fully equipped by Prof Dokubo within a short period in office. It was the hallmark of week-long activities embarked upon by Prof Dokubo, including the commissioning of the Amnesty Programme liaison office in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and the distribution of starter packs for empowerment of residents of communities impacted during the Niger Delta crises.
