Form EC8B of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) meant for Kano State, surprisingly found its way to Oyo State capital, thus creating a mild drama on Wednesday at the Central Bank of Nigeria branch in Dugbe, Ibadan. The election material, which is one of the sensitive election materials, is the result sheet for a particular ward within a state. PUNCH reports that it observed that at the CBN premises around 5.30pm, while sorting of the materials was ongoing, a group of INEC officials, including ad hoc ones, suddenly raised an alarm. “Eh! For Kano… Noted,” they exclaimed, as a woman raised up the form. One of them subsequently took the form to a superior INEC official, who documented it in a register. When asked how the discovery would be handled, a senior official of the Commission supervising the sorting said “We will give it to the CBN to return it to Kano State as soon as possible,” the official, who did not disclose his name, said. Asked if there were other discoveries of such, he said, “For now, that is the only one we have found.” The official added that the sensitive materials would be dispatched to different local government areas of the state as soon as the sorting ends. Efforts to get the comment of the INEC Head of Publicity in the state, Mr. Olayiwola Arowolo, on the development proved abortive as calls made to his line were not answered.
