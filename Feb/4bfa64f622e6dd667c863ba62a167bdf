President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday coasted home to victory in his home state of Katsina even as the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the three senatorial seats in the state. Results released by INEC in the state indicated that APC had landslide victory. Buhari defeated the standard bearer of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, with a wide margin of votes in virtually all the local government areas in the state. The elections were not without mishaps as one ad-hoc staff of the electoral umpire was abducted by gunmen yesterday in Safana local government Area while two others (presiding officers) were said to have absconded with the results of the Saturday’s elections at their polling units in Wakilin Yamma11 ward in the state capital. Consequently, the affected polling units’ results were cancelled by the electoral officer in Katsina local government area after all efforts to trace the two officers failed. The spokesman of the state police command, Isah Gambo, could not be reached for comment on the matter as he did not pick calls sent to his mobile phone at press time yesterday.
