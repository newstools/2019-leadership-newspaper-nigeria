The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday restored all candidates contesting in the 2019 general elections in Zamfara State to the ballot papers. The commission said since it had consistently maintained that it would always obey court judgments and orders, contestants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State had now been added in the ballot papers pending final determination of the issue, which can go to the Supreme Court. A statement issued by INEC national commissioner and chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Barr Festus Okoye, disclosed that the commission had yesterday, in compliance with the said order of a court, restored the APC to the ballot in the National Assembly, governorship and State House of Assembly elections scheduled for today and March 9, 2019. “ln the case of the All Progressives Congress in Zamfara State, the Federal High Court Abuja and the Zamfara State High Court issued conflicting orders relating to the participation of the APC in the two strands of elections scheduled for 23rd February and 9th March 20l9. “While the former ruled that the APC, having failed to conduct party primaries, cannot field candidates in the said election, the latter decided that it can field candidates having conducted valid party primaries. “However, the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division, on 21st February, 2019 set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja, for ‘lack or want of jurisdiction on the part on the lower court.’ This in effect means that the Zamfara State High Court‘s decision (to the effect) that the APC can field candidates for the National Assembly, governorship and State Assembly elections is the only valid and subsisting order,” the statement noted.
