The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Bauchi has distanced itself from the announcement of results being peddled around in social media. In a statement signed by the Head of Department, Voter Education and Publicity, Ahmed Alhaji Waziri, the commission urged residents to disregard such results. According to Waziri, the Commission is calling on well-meaning Nigerians to ignore such results as it is capable of overheating the polity. The statement reads in part, “the attention of the Independent National Electoral Commission Bauchi has been drawn to the circulation of Presidential and National Assembly results on the social media. “It is on this background that the Commission is calling on the general public to ignore all such results as the INEC is the only institution recognised by law as contained in section, 27of the Electoral act 2010 (as amended) to make such announcements”.
