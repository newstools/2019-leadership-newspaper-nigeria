No fewer than 10 fake Police officers and 15 others on illegal duties loaded in an 18-seater bus were on Friday arrested in Lokoja by the Kogi State Police Command. This is coming 24 hours after security operatives under Operation Total Freedom reportedly arrested four illegally armed Naval officers deployed to disrupt tomorrow’s polls in the state. LEADERSHIP gathered that the 15 Police officers on illegal duties confessed that they were attached to a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stalwart in the state. Confirming the arrest, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Hakeem Busari said the arrest followed an order given to Police officers from the state Command to stop and search to prevent influx of fake security personnel in the state. He recalled there was a directive from Force Headquarters, Abuja, that all state Commands should check the inflow of security personnel coming into any state to prevent fake security personnel during elections. Busari noted that investigation was still ongoing on the arrested Police personnel. Kogi State government had on Thursday issued a statement announcing that security operatives under Operation Total Freedom arrested four illegally armed Naval officers deployed to disrupt tomorrow’s polls in the state. According to a statement by director general of media and publicity to the state governor, Kingsley Fanwo, the Naval officers were sent to work with a PDP chieftain in Mopamuro local government area of the state, Commodore Michael Folusho Daniel (rtd) and other PDP leaders in the area. Fanwo said the arrest was a confirmation of the state government’s position that the PDP is only interested in winning the elections through violence and corruption.
