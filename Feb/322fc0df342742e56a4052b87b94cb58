Customs operatives believed to be members of the Federal Operating Unit in Kaduna/Katsina States Area Command of the Customs, yesterday morning, reportedly shot dead no fewer than five persons. LEADERSHIP Friday gathered that the incident occurred between Miltakwas and Agangaro Villages, near North West Farm, along Katsina Jibia-Road, when about five J-5 buses, said to be conveying bags of smuggled rice, overtook and squeezed into a convoy of several Golf Volkswagen vehicles filled with supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Jibia on their way to Katsina for the mega rally of President Muhammadu Buhari. It was further gathered that a number of persons that narrowly cheated death but sustained gun-shot injuries in the fatal incident in Jibia Local Government Area of the state were abandoned by the customs officials who fled the scene to escape reprisal attack by irate relatives of the victims. The spokesman of the Customs Area Command in Katsina, Theophilus Duniya, could not be reached for comments while the State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Isah Gambo, a superintendent of police, said he was unaware of the tragedy as at press time, yesterday.
