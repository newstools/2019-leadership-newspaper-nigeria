Lagos State Government in conjunction with the Transport sub-Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Wednesday said it would restrict vehicular movement in about 18 routes around Surulere axis on Saturday, urging market women, residents and transporters to stay away from the axis. The former Minister of State for Defense, Mr Demola Seriki, who is also the Chairman Transport Committee on President Muhammadu Buhari’s campaign Visit to Lagos State disclosed this at a press conference in Lagos. He appealed to Lagosians to stay off Teslim Balogun Stadium, venue of the mega rally located in Surulere axis of the state. Seriki, who was accompanied by the state’s Commissioner for Transportation, Ladi Lawanson, the General Manager of LASTMA, Wale Musa, the state FRSC sector Commander Hygenius Omeje and other stakeholders in the state, said that the roads would be shut between 10 am to 6pm. He said: “The visit, billed for Saturday, February 9, 2019 will afford the President opportunity to meet with the people and address them directly about his plans and programmes for them if re-elected into office in the forthcoming general elections. As is usual, especially at this time when elections are in the air, coupled with the fact that the President has a large following across the land whose throng to the venue of the campaign visit at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere, will expectedly affect the traffic situation in the metropolis.’’ Also speaking, the General Manager, LASTMA, Mr Wale Musa said that 500 officials of the agency would be deployed to manage traffic on the day while the FRSC boss, Omeje said that trucks and tankers had been warned to stay away from Lagos from Friday to Saturday.
