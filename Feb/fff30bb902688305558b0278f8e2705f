Justice A. Lewis-Allagoa of the Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday ordered the temporary forfeiture of the sum of N1.4 billion found in the bank account of Magel Resort Ltd, a company allegedly linked to the former first lady of Nigeria, Dame Patience Jonathan, to the federal government. Justice Lewis-Allagoa’s ordered that the money allegedly lodged in three deposits with Fidelity Bank Plc on May 20 and 25, 2015, be kept in the custody of the government after listening to an ex parte application filed by the EFCC to that effect. The anti-graft agency claimed in an affidavit attached to the application that it got an intelligence report that a bank account domiciled in Fidelity Bank had a huge sum of money that was not being used by anybody. The commission stated that upon receipt of the intelligence, it swung into action by conducting preliminary investigation, which revealed that Patience Jonathan and some relatives of former President Goodluck Jonathan were directors of the company. Others named as directors are Oba Tamunotonye, Goodluck Jonathan Aruera, Goodluck Jonathan Ariwabai and Esther Fynface. The EFCC claimed that in trying to trace the origin of the money, it was discovered that N500,000 was deposited on  May 20, 2015 by Fynface, who is alleged to be in charge of the company, while N1 billion was transferred in two tranches on May 25, 2015 from PAGMAT Oil and Gas Nigeria Ltd, a company that was not incorporated with the Corporate Affairs Commission. In his ruling on the application, Justice Lewis-Allagoa held that “an interim forfeiture order is granted to the federal government in the sum of N1,000,494,000 (one billion, four hundred and ninety four thousand naira only) in the Bank account of the 1st respondent, Magel Resort Ltd 4011019546 which is maintained with 2nd respondent, Fidelity Bank Plc”. The judge also directed that the forfeited sum be deposited in the Treasury Single Account of the federal government.
