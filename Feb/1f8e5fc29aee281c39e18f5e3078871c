A former governor of Enugu State, Chimaraoke Nnamani, has won the Senatorial election for Enugu East in his ward. Speaking to journalists in his Agbani residence, Nnamani, who is the senatorial candidate of the PDP for the zone, said so far, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has conducted a successful election. According to him, “We have had a smooth, free and fair election. Even though one would have expected larger turnout, I believe maybe the postponement dampened the enthusiasm of our people. “But democracy is alive and working. It is not about rating, the pool is successful and INEC so far, has conducted a successful election. It is not about rating apart from the postponement, which was highly regrettable, we are talking about 2019. Nigeria is part of the global economy, we are part of the global community in this digital age,” he said.
