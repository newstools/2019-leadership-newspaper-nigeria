Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Pastor Tonye Cole, has declared that he and his supporters have unshaken faith in the nation’s judiciary despite the Supreme Court ruling, insisting that his substantive case and other pending matters are yet to be determined by the apex court. Cole, in a statement on Friday, signed by the spokesman of Cole/Giadom Campaign Organization, Hon. Ogbonna Nwuke, said the only issued ruled by the apex court was on legal representation. The statement was reacting to the recent ruling of the Supreme Court, which declared the judgment of the Rivers State High Court on Ibrahim Umar and 22 others versus the APC. It reads in part: “Our attention has been drawn to reports which suggest that Ibrahim Umar & 22 others have secured a final determination at the Supreme Court. “The facts available to us is that the only issue determined today, Friday, 8th February, 2019 was that of legal representation, which had been in contention. “Based on the various conflicting headlines being carried, it is critical to state that there are other pending matters, including the substantive appeal, which is yet to be determined by the Supreme Court. Our faith in the judiciary remains unshaken. “We wish to urge our numerous supporters not to panic, following the deliberate misrepresentation of facts on the social media and elsewhere regarding the outcome of today’s judgement. We shall surely be triumphant in the end.”
