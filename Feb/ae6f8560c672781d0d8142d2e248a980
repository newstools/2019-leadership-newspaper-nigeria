Wife of the president, Mrs Aisha Buhari has again raised the alarm that members of the opposition parties were planning to disrupt the forthcoming general election in the country. Speaking at the Federal Capital Territory, All Progressives Congress (FCT-APC) Women and Youth Town Hall meeting, in Abuja yesterday, Aisha Buhari urged Nigerian women and youths to be on guard to ensure that the evil machinations of the detractors are frustrated. Represented by a former deputy governor of Plateau State, Mrs Paulline Tallen, the wife of the president noted that the APC-led administration, under President Buhari has performed more than any other past administrations in Nigeria. She maintained that President Muhammadu Buhari is the only Nigerian leader that has ever completed projects started by his predecessors in office. “Our detractors are planning all manner of things to prevent peaceful election. They don’t want things to be done the way it should be done in this country. We must pray that we have a peaceful election. Mr President has done what no one has done. He has not abandoned any projects started by his predecessors, because he believes in continuity. He had ensured that any good project is completed.” Earlier, the director general, central working committee of APC, women and youth presidential campaign team, Buba Marwa stated that President Muhammadu Buhari remains a saleable candidate whose integrity and transparency are unique points that would give him victory in the forthcoming election.  Marwa charged the women and youths resident in the FCT to muster more efforts towards the party’s house-to-house campaign, with emphasis on showcasing the achievements of the administration.
