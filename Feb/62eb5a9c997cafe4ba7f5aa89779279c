The Nigeria Police Force on Wednesday said it would soon prune down or withdraw its Special Protection Unit (SPU) and Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) operatives attached to certain categories of personalities. The acting Inspector-General of Police ( I-G), Mr Mohammed Adamu, made the disclosure at a meeting with Commanders of SPU and CTU in Abuja. He said that the decision to withdraw the personnel was aimed at ensuring full mobilisation and deployment of the personnel for the upcoming general elections. Adamu said that the force expected a highest level of professionalism from the officers during the elections as their conduct would be subjected to national and international scrutiny. He said that adequate provision had been made for the welfare of policemen while they would be performing their duty during the elections. The police boss said that the two units were established to complement the Police Mobile Force (PMF) towards supporting conventional police in addressing critical internal security threats and civil disorders. He said that personnel of the SPU and CTU were critical components of the broad election security plan of the force. Adamu added that the meeting was basically directed at engaging commanders of the CTU and SPU of the force. “It is for this reason that you are all invited here to brainstorm and be briefed on the specific roles that you will be expected to perform during the elections,” he said. He said that the units were expected to provide specialialised protection for the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) staff, NYSC, among others, during the elections. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the I-G also held similar strategic meetings with the 36 command Commissioners of Police (CPs), FCT and PMF commanders across the country.
