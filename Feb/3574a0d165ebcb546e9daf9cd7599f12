Capital market operators yesterday predicted that the Nigeria equities market would experience mixed performance as investors await the result of the presidential election. Some of them said in Lagos that the market would also witness mixed performance during the week following investors ‘wait-and-see attitude’ pending when the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would announce the overall winner of the presidential election. Ola Oni, a chartered stockbroker and chief executive officer, Sofunix Investment and Communications, said that investors would likely adopt the waiting attitude at the moment. He said that investors would only react to material information based on who wins the presidential election. According to him, the direction of the market would be ascertained after INEC must have released the final results of the just concluded presidential and National Assembly elections. For his part, Ambrose Omordion, the chief operating officer, InvestData Ltd., posited that the market would experience mixed sessions in the new week as players would factor the outcome of the presidential election into their activities. Omordion said that investors would also factor the results of the presidential election that were gradually tricking in and the 2018 audited results anticipated in the market. He said: “The ongoing volatility will persist as investors and fund managers reposition their portfolios, with eyes fixed on political space and ongoing full year company earnings position and post-election market dynamics.” Omordion advised investors to go for equities with intrinsic value to avoid unnecessary loss. He said: “We advise investors to allow numbers guide their decisions while repositioning in any stock, especially now that stock prices remain low in the midst of mixed company numbers, weak economic and market fundamentals.” NAN reports that a turnover of 1.48 billion shares worth N17.65 billion were traded by investors in 20,449 deals.
