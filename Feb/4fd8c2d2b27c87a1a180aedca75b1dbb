The Air Task Force (ATF) of ‘Operation Lafiya Dole’, the military force fighting insurgency in the Northeast,  has recorded another successful hit on Boko Haram terrorists, destroying their camp and killing their fighters at a settlement called Arboko in Borno State. The director of Publicity and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the operation was carried out on February 18, 2019 while a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha Jet and an Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform were providing close air support to troops of 82 Brigade, Nigerian Army. He noted that in the course of the operation, the ISR aircraft spotted a group of Boko Haram fighters within Arboko village and directed the Alpha Jet to engage their camp with rocket fire, thereby destroying the terrorists’ structures and neutralising many of their fighters. He reiterated that NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, would sustain its efforts in the campaign to destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the Northeast.
