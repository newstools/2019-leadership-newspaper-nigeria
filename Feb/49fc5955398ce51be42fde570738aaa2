The vice presidential candidate of Grassroots Democratic Party of Nigeria (GDPN), Alhaji Ibrahim Modibbo has dumped his presidential candidate and party for President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Declaring his total support for Buhari in Abuja, Modibbo said Buhari’s performance in the past three and a half years proved that he deserves a second term. He said that Buhari has all that Nigeria and Nigerians needed and deserves massive support on Saturday’s election to consolidate on developmental projects. Modibbo asserted that some years back the country was under the control of cabals that did not wish anything good for the common people. According to him, in sub-Saharan Africa, Buhari’s fight against corruption stands him out among others within the region. He said with the coming of Buhari about four years ago, cases of bad economy, insurgency and unemployment have become things of the past. He explained that re-electing Buhari would re-launch the country into another phase of development. “Buhari’s performance within three years in office shows that re-electing him will bring more positive impacts on Nigerians, especially in the area of agricultural development and improved economy. I have decided to join him because of what he is doing, and there is need to support him to do more,” he said. Receiving him and his supporters, the coordinator of Youths and Women Presidential Campaign Team, Bubba  Marwa commended Modibbo for his decision, assuring him that better days are ahead for Nigerians who believe in the spirit of Buhari. Maruwa said the President and his party were committed to doing more for a better society where everyone will be proud. He said there was no regret supporting Buhari/Osinbajo’s reelection.
