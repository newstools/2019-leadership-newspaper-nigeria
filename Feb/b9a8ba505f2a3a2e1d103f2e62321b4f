Igbo socio-cultural association, the Ohaneze- Ndigbo, Borno state chapter, has disowned various groups using the name of the association to campaign for politicians in Borno. The president of the Igbo apex body in Borno, Mazi Uche Azubuko said this yesterday at a press conference in Maiduguri, the Borno state capital. Azubuko added that Ohaneze-ndigbo in Borno as a body, accommodates every politician that will come to them for votes, irrespective of political party affiliation, saying that Igbos in the state have been told to vote a candidate of their choice in the forthcoming general elections. He warned that a situation where some groups of people for selfish interests, campaign for politicians, with the common name that Igbos are known for will not be tolerated. He used the opportunity to  inform members of the public that the only known Igbo hall for the purpose of any gathering concerning affairs of Ohaneze-ndigbo in Borno,  is the Igbo hall at Wulari, Jerusalem, which is adjacent CAN centre in Maiduguri. He therefore urged Igbos in the state to disregard the activities of such groups and vote a candidate of their choice in the general elections. Azubuko added that the press conference became necessary to avoid actions that will pitch Igbo populace in Borno against a section of people in the society, noting that the Igbos in the state are yet to recover from the brutality meted them, during the reign of the Boko Haram terrorists in the capital city, where lives were lost, as well as businesses destroyed. “It has come to the knowledge of Ohaneze-ndigbo, Borno state chapter , that some persons are using Igbo name to play politics. “We accommodate every politician that will come to us soliciting for votes irrespective of political party affiliation . We are urging our people to vote vigorously for candidates of their choice. We are not imposing our people to any political party or politician for the 2019 elections,” he said.
