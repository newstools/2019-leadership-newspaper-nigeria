The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has  adopted President Muhammadu Buhari as its candidate for the 2019 election. The decision was reached at the NEC meeting in Abuja on Thursday. The Director of Media and Publicity, Yemi Akinbode, said the party also suspended its National Publicity Secretary, Alfa Muhammad. “The National Executive Council (NEC) of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has resolved to adopt President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as candidates of our party for the 2019 presidential election. “Members of the SDP are enjoined to vote for President Buhari at the presidential level only, ” he said. Akinbode said that the party was not going into merger with the APC but explained the party’s decision was due to its inability to present a candidate. This, he explained, was due to a “lingering legal battle” between Donald Duke, the winner of the SDP presidential primaries and his major challenger, Prof. Jerry Gana. “We, therefore, feel that it is imperative to technically withdraw from the presidential election and focus on the National Assembly, governorship and state assembly elections, for which we have fielded candidates across the country.” The party also suspended its National Publicity Secretary, Muhammad, for allegedly breaching its constitution by indulging in anti-party activities. SDP last December, was one of the parties, along with GDPN and Kowa  that denounced the loose coalition of parties cobbled by the PDP party as CUPP. SDP is at present embroiled  with court cases over its candidate  for the presidential election. Former minister  Prof Jerry Gana, and former Cross River State Governor, Donald Duke, are fighting over the ticket.
