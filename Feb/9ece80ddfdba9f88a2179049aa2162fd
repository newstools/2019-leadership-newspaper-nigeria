Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has appealed to indigenous Christians in the state not to be apolitical so that they can be adequately represented in the governance of the state. The governor gave the piece of advice at a special prayer session in Kafur for peace and hitch-free 2019 general elections which was organised by the Christian faithful in Katsina South Senatorial Zone under the auspices of Funtua zone of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). Masari, who revealed that he lobbied then Governor Umar Musa Yarâ€™Adua to create the office of special assistant on Christian pilgrimage when he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives, promised that the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) would continue to ensure that Christians are not marginalised. While he commended the Christians for organising the session, he appealed to ensure the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and himself for the sustenance of meaningful development at both the national and state levels. The secretary to the state government (SSG) and chairman of Katsina APC Governorship Campaign Council, Dr. Mustapha Inuwa, applauded the Christian community for supporting the current administration since its inception. He pledged that the Buhari and Masari administrations would consolidate on their achievements in their first tenure. CAN state chairman, Rev. Nelson Nwachukwu, expressed gratitude to Governor Masari for sponsoring Christians to visit Jerusalem, while the Funtua zone chairman, Rev. Ishaya Garba Jurau, poured encomiums on the governor for according rights which were hitherto denied indigenous Christians in the state to them.
