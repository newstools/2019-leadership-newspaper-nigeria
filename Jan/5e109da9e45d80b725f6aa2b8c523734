Former vice president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has pledged to reverse the 10 million jobs lost in the past three years through aggressive youth and women empowerment when elected at next month’s presidential poll. Atiku made the promise at the PDP presidential campaign rally at Polo Field, Minna, the Niger State capital yesterday. He assured that if elected, he would create jobs for women and youths and  asserted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) government instead of creating three million jobs it promised made the country’s active class to lose about 10 million jobs. While emphasising that the APC government failed in the three sectors it promised to change, Atiku said that “I want to promise you that the insecurity they are not able to control, we shall control.” He reiterated that APC had failed in its three programmes of fighting  insecurity, boosting the economy and fight against corruption,  adding that even the PDP they said did nothing in 16 years built the roads, schools and hospitals in the country. “It is time to sack the APC government, let them pack their things and go, Buhari must go, APC must go,” he told his supporters, who converged on the venue to receive him with shouts of “Sai Atiku”. A representative of the PDP national chairman, Elder Yemi Akinwumi, said that in order to be sure that the rigging will not take place in 2019 election, the service chiefs and those that have over stayed in office must be relieved of their appointments. Also, the state PDP leader and former governor of Niger State, Dr. Muazu Babangida Aliyu, urged the people to vote and protect their votes to stop the rigging of the general elections. Former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, the Niger State PDP governorship candidate, Umar Nasko, Senate President Bukola Saraki and Tanimu Turaki, criticized the APC government for its unfulfilled promises.
