The Police have insisted that its operatives will not retreat and will stay put at the house of senator Dino Melaye until he is arrested for case of attempted culpable homicide. The police said the alleged offence was committed by Senator Dino Melaye and his armed thugs in Kogi State on July 19, 2018 when they shot and wounded a police officer, Sgt Danjuma Saliu, attached to 37 Police Mobile Force (PMF) while on duty at a stop and search point along Aiyetoro Gbede, Mopa Road in Kogi State. Force PRO, Jimoh Moshood, while addressing the press on day four of the siege, yesterday, said “operatives currently in the residence of Senator Dino Melaye will not retreat and are there to effect his arrest to answer to the case of attempted culpable homicide on the shooting of a Police Officer,  Sgt Danjuma Saliu, attached to 37 Police Mobile Force (PMF) while on duty at a stop and search point along Aiyetoro Gbede, Mopa Road in Kogi State”. “The Police Officer is yet to recover from the gunshot injury he sustained during the attack and is still under intensive medical care.” While clarifying that the senator was duly invited for questioning on July 23, but he failed to appear, Moshood said “the Police investigators had written the Clerk of the National Assembly for Senator Dino Melaye to report at Kogi State Police Command, CIID, Lokoja for him to answer to these offences against him under investigation in Kogi State Police Command but he has bluntly refused to report himself to the Police. “The Police operatives will continue to be in wait at the residence of Senator Dino Melaye until he surrenders himself for arrest. The offence for which Senator Dino Melaye is being investigated is capital in nature. “The Force will not tolerate attack on his personnel by any individual no matter how highly placed. The law must take its course.”
