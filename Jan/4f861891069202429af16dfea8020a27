There are indications that the Acting Inspector-General of Police, IGP Muhammed Adamu has approved the retirement of seven Deputy Inspectors General of police, who were his seniors. Our correspondent gathered yesterday night that formal disengagement letters will be issued to the affected officers within the week. The seven DIGs were identified as having joined the police before IGP Adamu and all may likely give way as it has been the norm in Police. The DIGs are Maigari Dikko, the DIG in charge of finance and administration; Habila Joshak, the DIG in charge of operations; Emmanuel Inyang, information and communications technology. Others are Agboola Oshodi-Glover, logistics and supply; Mohammed Katsina, research and planning; Sani Mohammed, training and development; and Peace Ibekwe-Abdallah, federal criminal investigation and intelligence. The seven DIGs all served in the management team of former IGP, Ibrahim Idris. Though the police are yet to officially issue a statement concerning the retirement, one of the affected DIGâ€™s aide confirmed the report of the retirement. He stated that his boss was yet to receive official communication to that effect but said all will be sorted out this week . When our correspondent contacted the Police Service Commission for confirmation of the DIGs retirement, its spokesman said the news was untrue. The Force PRO, Frank Mba also denied knowledge of the retirement.
