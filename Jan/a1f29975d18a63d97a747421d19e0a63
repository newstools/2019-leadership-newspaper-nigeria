Northwestern states may prescribe stiffer penalties to curtail increasing cases of kidnapping and other crimes in the next political dispensation, Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State, has hinted. Specifically, the governor vowed to spearhead moves to expunge outdated law on kidnapping and review the five pounds fine or few monthsâ€™ imprisonment for kidnapping under the existing law if his administration is given a second term mandate in the forthcoming elections. Masari, who expressed displeasure at the archaic law during the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign rally in Batsari, was confident that the law would be reviewed and replicated in the northwestern states to contain the crime wave in the zone. The governor, who had equally hinted that the governors in the Northwest geopolitical zone would meet in Kaduna this week over the spate of kidnapping and other crimes, confirmed that no fewer than six informants conspiring with kidnap suspects were apprehended by security operatives last Friday in the state. He assured that the APC administration would not rest on its oars in fighting all forms of criminality and appealed to the public to provide useful information to law enforcement agencies on persons aiding and abetting kidnappings in the state.
