Wife of former Vice president and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Titi, was on Friday evening attacked by suspected political thugs at Sarkin Sasa house in Ojoo area of Ibadan, Oyo State. Mrs. Abubakar had arrived in the city two days ago to solicit support for her husbandâ€™s presidential bid. An eyewitness revealed that she had had a fruitful discussion with Sarkin Sasa and the Hausa community in the area when the hoodlums attacked her convoy. Some of the supporters in the convoy were said to have been injured in the attack. A chieftain of the PDP in the state, Alhaji Bisi Olopoenia, confirmed the development to our correspondent but said the party was investigating the attack on the harmless visitors. He said there were insinuations that the attackers demanded money from the visitors and after they were allegedly given, some of them still went ahead to foment trouble. Efforts to reach the State Police Public Relation Officer, Adekunle Ajisebutu, were unsuccessful as of the time of filing this report.
