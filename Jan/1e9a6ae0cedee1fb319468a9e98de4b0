Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, declared that the N-Power beneficiaries would be increased from the present figure to one million beneficiaries, if people cast their votes for President Buhari. Osinbajo, while speaking at the Palace of His Royal Majesty, Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Jimoh Oladuni Oyewumi, during a campaign visit to the monarch, said “we are here for campaign, President Buhari has done a lot in his short period in office, we still want to do more. We have empowered our teeming youths, through N-power program, and we still want to employ more youths for the N-power program. Currently we have 500,000 N-power beneficiaries, and we are intending to increase the number of N-power beneficiaries to one million beneficiaries across the nation. “We have empowered our women through our home grown feeding program, we have given out soft loans to the petty traders across the states through Traders Moni program, we have given out money to our big market women through our Market Moni programmes. President Buhari has mercy of the people at heart, if given chance to come again, we will do more for our people.” In his response, the Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Oyeyemi, welcomed the vice president and his campaign team and also prayed for their safety on their journey back to Abuja. He said, “I welcome you our vice president, Prof Yemi Osinbajo and the entire campaign crew of President Buhari and Osinbajo to Ogbomoso, and I pray for your safe return trip to your base. Osinbajo and his team, however, paid a visit to some patients at the Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso and later moved straight to Iluju market at Oriire local government, as well as Ikoyi Ile, the headquarter of Oriire local government.
