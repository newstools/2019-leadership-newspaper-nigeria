EFCC Files N500m Fraud Charge Against Babachir Lawal Also yesterday, EFCC filed a 10-count charge of fraud and fraudulent acquisition of properties against former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), David Babachir Lawal and two other persons. EFCC sources said he will be arraigned nextweek. Also listed in the charge are Rholavision Engineering Ltd and Josmon Technologies Ltd, two companies allegedly used to perpetrate the contract fraud. The charges were filed at a High Court in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Others listed as defendants in the case are the director of Rholavision Engineering Ltd, Hamidu, David Lawal, another staff of the company, Sulaiman Abubakar, and managing director of Josmon Technologies Ltd, Apeh Monday. While Lawal allegedly awarded different contracts amounting to about N560million to companies where he held personal interest, his co-defendants were charged for abetting the SFG to own private interests in the companies and in the award of contracts to them. The charges read: “That you Hamidu David Lawal being a director of Rholavision Engineering Ltd, Sulaiman Abubakar, being a staff of Rholavision Engineering Ltd, Apeh Monday John, being the managing director of Josmon Technologies Ltd and Rholavision Engineering Ltd on or about 4th March, 2016 in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory did abet the holding indirectly of a private interest by Engineer Babachlr Davld Lawal in the award of contract to Josmon Technologies Ltd for the removal of invasive plant species and simplified irrigation by the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (OSGF) through the Presidential Initiative for North East (PINE) to the tune of N272,524,356.02 which Rholavision Engineering Ltd executed and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 26 (1) (c) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000 and punishable under Section 12 of the same Act,” Count 9 of the charge reads.

The committee, chaired by Senator Sheu Sani alleged that PINE spent several millions of naira to cut grass. Rholavision was said to have gotten suspicious payments of N200million from the contract. Sequel to the allegations, President Buhari in October 2017, relieved Babacahir of his duty as SGF and announced the appointment of Boss Gida Mustapha as his successor. The Osinbajo panel also indicted him in its report.
