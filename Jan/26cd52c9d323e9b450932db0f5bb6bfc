The Hijab crisis rocking the International School, Ibadan, has replicated itself in LAUTECH International School, Ogbomoso, where 55 female students who wore hijab to school on Monday were barred from entering the school premises. It was gathered that though Hijab is presently not part of the school’s dress code the students decided to wear it to school. A Muslim senior lecturer in LAUTECH, who pleaded anonymity, said the Muslim parents decided that as from 2019, their female children must wear hijab. He said the parents took the decision because the school’s governing council has refused to grant a request that had been made since 2011. According to him, they had waited for eight years without any word from the school authorities. He said: “Our Muslim girls over the period have been using Beret instead of Hijab in their own case contrary to the Islamic dictate.’’ The management of LAUTECH yesterday sent the students back when the decided to dare the school authority and wore hijab to school.
