The founder of the Divine Hand of God Prophetic Ministry, Abuja, Prophet Emmanuel Omale, has prophesied that the 2019 polls will be peaceful, urging Nigerians not to be afraid. Omale also said he foresees the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari, reelected after the presidential election despite spirited efforts by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, to unseat him. In his yearly prophetic message, Prophet Omale, however, warned that there would be some pockets of skirmishes but that the general outcome of the exercise would be positive. He urged for prayers against massive resurgence of terrorist attacks in some parts of the country just as he said the fight to eliminate and discourage corrupt practices would get a boost during the year. He added that the current chairman of EFCC, Mr Ibrahim Magu, would be confirmed. He called on the federal government to handle the Shiite uprising carefully to avoid it from deteriorating. He said, “Atiku will show amazing efforts in the coming elections but I see President Buhari ruling again. However, President Buhari would require serious prayers for his health as this could be an avenue to sway judicial victory in favour of Atiku.” He added, “There will be a peaceful election process, we should not be afraid. Though there shall be pockets of skirmishes, the general outlook still looks good and quite far from the negative mindset prevailing. “What Nigerians should worry about is a massive resurgence of terrorist attacks; early morning train passengers should be vigilant and prayerful always.” On the international scene, he said,  “A West African president needs prayers to avert bereavement. “President Emmanuel Macron may lose his seat, German economy will witness a dip so investors should hedge wisely. “Prime Minister Theresa May of UK may not survive as Prime Minister in 2019 as she will succumb to a 2nd Referendum on BREXIT.”
