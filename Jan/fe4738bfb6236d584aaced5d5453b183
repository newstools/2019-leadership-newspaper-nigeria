The federal government in a bid to pressure organised labour to shelve its proposed strike on minimum wage, has scheduled a meeting for tomorrow. A statement signed by the director of Press, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Samuel Olowokere, indicates that the minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige will meet with the executives of the organised labour union towards nipping in the bud threat of national industrial action by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) over the transmission of the New National Minimum Wage Bill to the National Assembly. When contacted to confirm receipt of invitation for the meeting, general secretary of the NLC, Dr. Peter Ozo-Eson, said that the labour had received letter from the ministry for a meeting on Friday. It is not however clear if labour would be attending as the body seems divided on the decision to attend further meetings. While the NLC general secretary said labour would honour the invitation, a source within NLC told our reporter that the leadership of the organised labour would not be attending the meeting. “The proposed January 4th meeting is dead on arrival, “ the source said. Labour had in its communiqué of December 20 said it would no longer attend any meeting on the minimum wage as the time for meeting has passed.
