Former deputy national chairman (South) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has described the attempt to remove the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, as “crude, immoral, illegitimate, and invalid.” In a statement he personally signed, George also described the attempt as “an assault on the rule of law, an outright savaging of the fundamental pivot upon which this democracy delicately rests.” He said: “The untidy backdoor intrusion on the independence of the judiciary not only puts this democracy at risk, it creates a creeping anomaly wherein the legislative and the judicial arms of the democratic tripod are being decimated by an overbearing executive, thereby reducing the nation to a dubious authoritarian rule. “The executive must be very cautious, and sensitive to the ethnic moderating balancing of this nation. For the impression out there is that a CJN from the minority section of our nation is being elbowed out to pave way for a preferred substitute. “This is definitely not right. This definitely looms with unfairness and distasteful totality,” he said. George said that barely 33 days before the general elections, the summative symbol of the judiciary is being dragged before a tribunal, with what he called a “hurried and apparently coordinated petition from one Dennis Aghanya, who used to work closely with the highest authority in the land! “Truly ‘something is rotten in Denmark’,” he concluded.
