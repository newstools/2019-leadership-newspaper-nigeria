In what could amount to a game-changer, key leaders of the Democratic Party of the United States are contemplating drafting Michelle Obama to contest the 2020 presidential election. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, is extremely popular with the base of the Democratic Party and a broad cross section of the country. Speaking with LEADERSHIP yesterday, a top Democrat in Washington DC confided in the newspaper that a lot of work is going on in that direction. “It’s a delicate proposition but we are looking at all the angles,” he said. The motivation for this is that the leaders of the Democratic Party are desperately searching for a candidate that will excite the electorate and set the polity on fire. And according to Gallup polls, Michelle Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, are the two most admired persons in the United States at the moment in both the female and male categories respectively. Michelle, like her husband, is a very good public speaker, very well educated – she was educated at Princeton University and Harvard Law School – some of the two best universities in the world and she is also a crowd puller. Her most famous quote “When they go low, we go high” still resonates around the world. Americans love history making epochs and if this goes through, the history making event itself would be historical. She would be the first female president, first black female president, first former black first lady, first former first lady of the first black president and many more. But whether the former first lady will accept the challenge or not remains to be seen.
