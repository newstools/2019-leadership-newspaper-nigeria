Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) acted within its powers by refusing Zamfara State chapter candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC). They won’t be able to participate in the next general elections. This was approved by the Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu, in a judgment on Friday. It wasn’t INEC fault that the APC failed to conduct a valid primary within the period scheduled by the electoral body. Justice Onjukwu said INEC’s action was intended to curb impunity among political parties and politicians; ensure that rule of law is adhered to. The judgment was on a suit filed in the name of APC by some individuals, who said they emerged from a consensus arrangement adopted by the party in Zamfara State.
