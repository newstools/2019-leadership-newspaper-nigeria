Rahama Sadau who was banned by Kannywood for indecency had the below to say in an interview about the love and support she received from fans. I wouldn’t want to talk about it. The love I receive from fans, friends and family every day is really encouraging and has kept me focused. She said. She also stated that she can’t play a role which will have her go nude. “I am a typical Northern Nigerian girl and I have roles that I wouldn’t play and lines that I will never cross. I can’t go nude or wear short clothes in any movie. Whether we like it or not, I belong to the North, and most of my fans are Northerners. So, I wouldn’t do anything that will frustrate my fans or make them my enemies.”
