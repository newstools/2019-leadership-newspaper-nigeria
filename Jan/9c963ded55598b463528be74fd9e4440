The All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari and Prof Charles Dokubo over the achievements of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, saying the programme has been positively transformed. The party made the commendation while appraising the achievements of President Buhari ahead of the 2019 general elections, noting that the active participation of the Niger Delta people in matters of national concern resulted from Dokubo’s untiring efforts at deepening the prevailing peace and stability in the region. In a letter of commendation signed by its national secretary, Mai Mala Buni, the APC applauded Dokubo’s efforts at ensuring development in the oil-rich region. It said the positive transformation of the Presidential Amnesty Programme was in line with the Change Agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. “The party commends your efforts to bring development to the all-important Niger Delta region and ensure that the region actively participates in matters of national concern, irrespective of political affiliations. “Under your watch, the Presidential Amnesty Programme has been positively transformed and has ensured stability in the Niger Delta region. This is in line with the Change Agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration as enshrined in our manifesto’’, the letter reads. “While there remains more work to be done in bringing about total and lasting peace to the region, we urge you not to relent, but continue to explore all means and avenues to ensure the success of the programme and its developmental initiatives for the region,” the party said. The party assured Dokubo of its cooperation, commitment and support towards sustaining peace in the Niger Delta.
