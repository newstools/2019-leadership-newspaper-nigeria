Following order of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) dated January 23, 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari on January 19, 2019 suspended the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, from office. The CCT ordered Justice Onnoghen to step aside as the CJN pending the determination of 6-count charge brought against him before the tribunal for false asset declaration. The CCT also ordered the President to swore in Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammed, being the next most senior Justice of the Supreme Court as the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria. Justice Muhammed an education administrator and jurist is coming at trying moment for the Judiciary. Perhaps, the most interesting thing about him is that little is ever heard about him. But he will go down the record as the first PhD holder to become CJN. Besides, Justice Tanko as he is often called, has never been mentioned in any scandal within or outside the judiciary.
