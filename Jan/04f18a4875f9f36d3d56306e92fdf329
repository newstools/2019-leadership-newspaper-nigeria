Pensioners under the auspices of NITEL/MTEL Pensioners Association Northwest Zone have commended President Muhammed Buhari and the Federal Government over the prompt payment of their monthly pension. According to the group, the payment of entitlement to the next of kins of their deceased members since October last year is also commendable. In a statement signed by its zonal chairman and zonal secretary, Comrade Samuel Idowu Jonathan and Comrade Yeekeen Adeyemi Suleiman respectively, the kind gesture from the Buhari-led government has gone a long way to ameliorate their sufferings. The association, which comprises workers who were retired before privatisation and those that were disengaged in 2006, also appealed to the Federal Government to fast track the payment of their seven years’ arrears. “Many of our members are dead while those alive have found themselves in difficult conditions and can’t pay their children’s school fees, medical bills and house rent.” The association also thanked the ministers of Finance, Communications and the Management of Pension Transitional Arrangement Department (PTAD) and other relevant agencies for their gesture and prayed for peaceful co-existence of the country. The association, however, distanced itself from a purported legal action undertaken by a group known as the Association of Former Telecoms Employers of Nigeria (ATEN), which they said is unknown to them adding that they were loyal to the leadership of Comrade Ibrahim Dasuki Nakande currently the Interim National Chairman of their association.
