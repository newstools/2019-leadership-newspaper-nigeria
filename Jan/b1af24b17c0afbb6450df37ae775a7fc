The international community and the federal government have been urged to question former president, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, over allegation of plot to destabilise the country. The Concerned Nigerian Masses, during a protest march said Obasanjo should also be put under house arrest ahead of the general elections. The group said it has followed the events in the political atmosphere in Nigeria with keen interest, especially as it concerns the presidential elections in Nigeria and is therefore of the opinion that urgent and proactive steps need to be taken to arrest the plot by ‘some agents of darkness’ towards plunging the country into  crisis of unprecedented proportion. Comrade Okpokwu Ogenyi, who led the protest from the Unity Fountain Abuja, to the Office of the Attorney General Of the Federation, AGF and later to the Presidential Villa in Abuja, warned that, if urgent steps are not taken, Nigeria might go up in flames. According to Ogenyi, “Without mincing words, the Concerned Nigerian Masses have it on good authority that an individual who claims to be an elder statesman has concluded plans in cahoots with other equally unscrupulous elements to cause mayhem in the country before and after the general elections.” The Concerned Nigerian Masses frowned at such evil plots by people that are supposed to work for the unity of Nigeria, but instead have opted to make the country ungovernable in an attempt to truncate our nascent democracy. The group accused former President Olusegun Obasanjo of being the arrowhead of the plot to allegedly destabilize the country and drew the attention of the federal government and the international community to the plot and demanded that action should be taken to avert looming danger.
