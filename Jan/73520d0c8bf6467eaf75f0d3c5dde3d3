The lawmaker representing Kogi West district, Senator Dino Melaye, has reportedly surrendered to the Nigeria Police Force after eight days in hiding. A source at the Force Headquarters in Abuja confirmed this on Friday. The police carried out a search of the lawmaker’s residence in the nation’s capital while he was taken to the office of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) in Guzape. Although Senator Melaye had earlier said he was not in the house, the police said he opened the door to the residence himself at about 3 pm today after which he was taken into custody.
