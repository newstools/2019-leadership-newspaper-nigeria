A  chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abubakar Gerei has said that the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State is a done deal. Speaking to  select journalists in Kaduna, the Adamawa born former Senator said, President Buhari is a movement that cannot be challenged by any opposition at the moment. He averred that President Buhari had performed creditable well within the past three and half years compared to the wasted years of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “President Buhari has been able to build confidence on the minds of an average Nigerian particularly the ordinary masses who will vote him again. “ Under his leadership, the spate of bombing and other social vices has reduced to the barest minimum and will get better when he gets reelected in February. “By every available indices, I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that President Buhari will not be reelected. It is also going to have effect on the Governors, and I can tell you that even Governor el-Rufai will also be reelected”. Although the Senator agreed that some things may not be going on perfectly well, he said, the President is not unaware of the challenges and that is why he has continued to reiterate commitment to make things better and take Nigeria to the next level.
