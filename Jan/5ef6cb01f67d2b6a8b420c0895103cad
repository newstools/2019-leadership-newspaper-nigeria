Thousands of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in Katsina State have defected to the governing All Progressives Congress (APC). APC leaders put the number of the defectors at 13,000 from the PDP in Musawa local government area of Katsina State. The decampees were received into the APC at the start of the party’s statewide campaign tour of Musawa. Addressing the defectors and other supporters of the APC at the Musawa rally, after he commissioned the 24km Mararrabar Sayaya-Sayaya–Mazoji Road at the weekend, governor Aminu Bello Masari expressed gratitude to God for giving him the opportunity to serve humanity through the project and others in the state. Masari, who is seeking a second term in office in the forthcoming general elections, said that the APC-led government at the state and federal levels had impacted positively on the people in several ways. He maintained that most of the promises made by the party to Katsina electorate in 2015 had been redeemed and urged the people to renew party’s mandate to consolidate on the achievements. Receiving the defectors, the state APC chairman, Shittu S. Shittu, assured them of fair treatment, adding that the party is out to better the lots of ordinary Nigerians. Shittu and other chieftains of the party at the rally urged the electorate to return APC to power in February and March elections to enjoy more dividends of democracy.
