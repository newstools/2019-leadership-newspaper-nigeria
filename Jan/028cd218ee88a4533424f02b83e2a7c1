The Ishola Balogun-Fulani led All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to urgently withdraw the list of candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Kwara State published by the commission last week. The party, in a letter, addressed to the Chairman, INEC, through its counsel, Yusuf Ali, and dated 21st January 2019, charged INEC to publish the names of the candidates submitted by its party in line with the judgement of Kwara State High Court. In the letter, which was also copied to the European Union, the Socio-Economic Right and Accountability Project (SERAP), the APC expressed dismay and bewilderment that INEC  published strange names as Senatorial and House of Representatives candidates of the party. “It is an undisputable fact that apart from the aforesaid judgement of the Kwara State High Court delivered on the 19th December, 2018, which has not been set aside by the Appeal Court, the only time the Court of Appeal sat in respect of the Appeal lodged against the Kwara State High Court judgement of the 19th December 2018 was the sitting of the Court of Appeal, Ilorin Division held on the 14th January 2019 during which the Court of Appeal never issued an order setting aside the judgement of Kwara State High Court delivered on the 19th December 2018,” the letter stated. The Balogun-Fulani led APC executive said what the Commission did by inserting ‘Court order’ against the names of the Senatorial and House of Representatives candidates when there is no court order to that effect sounds “criminal, fraudulent and deceitful manipulation or representation of facts by the Commission”. According to the letter, “it is gravely worrisome, curious and strange that names of persons that never obtained any judgement or order of court of competent jurisdiction would be accepted, countenanced, presented and/or put forward by your Commission as the lawful and legitimate candidates standing on the crest of ‘Court Order’ that was never obtained from or granted by any court of law in Nigeria.” The Kwara APC recalled that in judgement delivered on the 19th December, 2018, by the Kwara State High Court of Justice, Ilorin in which INEC was joined as the 5th Defendant, all its reliefs were granted by the court including the reliefs establishing that the Ishola Balogun-Fulani led executive is the authentic, valid and duly recognised Kwara State Executive Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) with four-year tenure of office commencing from the 6th June 2018, and with the constitutional power to conduct primary elections of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara State among other things.
