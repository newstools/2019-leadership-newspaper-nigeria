The presidency yesterday described as fake news allegations by the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) that the federal government was planning to arrest the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen, this week. In a statement by special adviser to the president on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, the presidency said the fake news is intended to set the judiciary against the executive and cause major confusion ahead of the forthcoming general elections. Adesina said, “We have read with considerable concern and surprise, the fake news of the presidency’s alleged plan to arrest the Chief Justice of Nigeria and frame three other Supreme Court Justices. “This false story is being peddled by the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) apparently to set the judiciary against the executive and cause major confusion ahead of the forthcoming general elections. “The story is absolutely false as the presidency is not in any way involved in plotting against or framing anybody”. The presidential spokesman noted that the findings of the Code of Conduct Bureau against the Chief Justice of Nigeria and the allegations arising from them are being handled by the courts in the normal way as is expected in a democratic society like ours. According to him, the presidency has not and will certainly not interfere in the process. Adesina continued: “We, however, want to draw the attention of the general public to this or similar false stories, which are ill motivated to further the political interests of their sponsors. “While the Buhari administration is very firmly committed to the fight against corruption, we want to assure the general public that Government will always pursue its mission with the highest standards of fairness, and in strict conformity with the relevant laws”.
