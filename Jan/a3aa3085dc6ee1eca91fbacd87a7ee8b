A lecturer with the Bayero University, Kano, Prof Dahiru Yahaya, has called on government to address issues relating to the detention of the former national security adviser, Col Sambo Dasuki (rtd), leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Sheik Ibrahim Zakzaky and a human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju. Speaking at a meeting of civil society activists held in Abuja at the weekend, Yahaya said government must respect the rule of law. “Because there are several Nigerian citizens languishing in various prisons due to non-compliance with court order or the other. Prominent among them at the moment is the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, Sheik Ibrahim Zakzaky, former security adviser, Col Sambo Dasuki, and a human right activist, Prince Deji Adeyanju.” The University Don urged the government to respect the tenets of democracy in all its dealings. “This would go a long way in giving confidence to the many political parties in the buildup to the general election,” Yahaya said. In her submission, rights activist, Miss Benedicta Kato, expressed concern over what she described as silencing of activists, describing the detention of Adeyanju as a move to clamp down on the opposing voice, which she added, won’t spell well for the Nigerian nascent democracy. Speaking earlier, one of the organisers of the programme and the coordinator, Initiative For Conciliation and Right Protection (ICRP), Shuaibu Isa Ahmad, explained that among the objective of the organisation is to bridge the gap between Nigerian Christians and Muslims in other to have peaceful and harmonious coexistence. “When we were children, we never knew the intolerance that we are experiencing at the moment. There is serious distrust among people at the moment, and it is not supposed to be so. We are supposed to be our brother’s keeper, “ he said.
