About 158 other members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which included a former youth leader of the party in Nuku-Sabon Gari ward of Abaji area council, Mr. Peter Yandu, have defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area. Yandu while speaking on behalf of the defectors at Nuku Primary School, said he and other members had been in PDP since 1999 but were later abandoned by the party they worked for. He explained that since the party has abandoned him and some members of the Nuku ward, he had decided to pitch tent with the ruling APC after series of consultation with some of his former PDP members in the area. Yandu noted that the ruling APC administration, under the leadership of Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, has performed well, especially in the area of infrastructure, education and youth empowerments. “It was on that note that I have decided to lead over 157 former members of the PDP to join APC today. And I want to assure the chairman that he will surely get 100% votes here in Nuku on election day by God’s grace,” he said. The chairman of Abaji chapter of the APC, Alhaji Haruna Mohammed Yaba, commended the former PDP youth leader and his team for joining APC, saying they should endeavor to gear up and work assiduously for the victory of the party during the election. Yaba assured the defectors that the party would carry them along in whatever decision they are make so that the party would continue to wax stronger. Also speaking, the chairman of the council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, advised the PDP defectors against being a mole in APC, saying they should come out openly to work for the party, right from the presidency down to the ward levels, during the election. The chairman expressed confidence that no matter the odds, APC shall emerged victorious during the upcoming general election, while urging them to remain firm in their decision in joining the APC.
