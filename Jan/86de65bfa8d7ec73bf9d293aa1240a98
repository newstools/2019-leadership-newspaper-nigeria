Family of the president-elect in the June1993 election, late Chief MKO Abiola yesterday berated former president Olusegun Obasanjo for refusing to recognise that their patriarch (late Abiola) won the election which was adjudged to be the freest in the history of Nigeria’s democracy. The family said the former president ignored sacrifices of late MKO and his wife Alhaja Kudirat Abiola because they are from the same Ogun state. The Abiola’s family particularly regretted that Obasanjo who benefited from the struggle of late Abiola and his late wife, Alhaja Kudirat  ignored the sacrifices of the couple which contributed immensely to the country’s return to democratic rule. Son of late MKO Abiola and Kudirat Abiola, Alhaji Jamiu Abiodun Abiola while ‘testimony of change’ yesterday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja noted that it took President Muhammodu Buhari who did not benefit from the struggle of late Abiola to recognise is election as president in June 1993. “I am the son of late Moshhod and Alhaja Kudirat ABiola, more than two decades ago, Nigerians came out and gave my father mandate across the entire country in recognition of his good deed, but unfortunately for him he was prevented from becoming the President and he was later killed, and also my mother Alhaja kudirat who stood with him, organised rallies when he was imprisoned and organised meetings even at 2am in the morning, of course, we all know what happened and how she was killed. Unfortunately for us, we felt another government would honour the sacrifices made by both of them when democracy is restored. “But the man who became president after my father’s demise, Chief Olusegun Obaanjo, who benefited from the blood and sacrifices of my both parent, refused to honour my father just because he is from the same state with my father. “At the end of the day, it took the great messiah, my messiah, President Muhhamodu Buhari who is not from Ogun state, who is not Yoruba and was not a beneficiary of my father’s struggle to honour my father and to acknowledge the fact that he won the election,” he said.
