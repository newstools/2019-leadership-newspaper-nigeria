Senator-elect for Kaduna Central, Malam Uba Sani, has called on Nigerians to use the blessings of the month of Ramadan for deep reflection and strengthening of the bond of brotherhood. In a message to Muslims as they commence this year’s 30-day Ramadan fast, the Senator-elect said the period should be seen by all as one for getting closer to the Almighty God as well as solidifying the bond of love for one another. “Ramadan as described in the Holy Qur’an, is one of the months made sacred by Allah in which there should not be conflicts of any nature. We should treat as such by shielding swords, reconciling with our fellow beings and concentrating on acts that would draw us closer to God,” he said. Senator Sani, urged the people of Kaduna Central on prayers for guidance for all categories of Nigerian leaders and for the general peace and prosperity of the country. “In this regard, the Ulama have an important role to play by preaching those vital religious fundamentals of love, compassion and piety, while avoiding inflammatory and inciting sermons,” he said. He tasked youths to embrace the Ramadan spirit by embracing it as a moment for deep reflections on the indispensability of peace, brotherhood and love for one another. Uba, however appealed to people who use the Ramadan period as opportunity for price hike of essential commodities to desist from so doing this time around.
