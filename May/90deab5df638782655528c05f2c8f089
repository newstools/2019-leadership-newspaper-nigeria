A leading legal practitioner and counsel to Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje before the Election Petition Tribunal sitting at Miller Road, Bompai, Kano has said that Ganduje has prepared 1,800 pages as his defence and is also ready to present them to 203 witnesses. “We are ready to tell the whole World that indeed, there was a free and fair election on March 23th, 2019, said his lawyer, Barrister Musa Abdullahi Lawan. Speaking after filing the governor’s defense before the State Elections’ Tribunal sitting at Milla road, Kano, Barrister MA Lawan, who is one of the leading counsels to the governor, said the PDP’s claims before the tribunal are not weighty. He said, “We brought in our processes in defense of the petition and we have done it in good time and we are very confident of winning and right from the beginning, we are saying the PDP petition was unnecessary”. Barrister MA Lawan said they are bringing in 203 witnesses who are key and they are to tell the Court that there was indeed an election and that the PDP petition was baseless. The Counsel to Ganduje dispelled rumours that the state had influenced the transfer of the Presiding Tribunal Judges to bring in those who would favour them, but insisted that there are 50 cases before the tribunal and most of them are too many for the tribunal to handle.
