The Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Abubakar Bawa Bwari, has hinted that occurrences of new and better grade minerals had been discovered in the country recently following the exploratory activities embarked upon by the Buhari administration. In his speech made available to LEADERSHIP, the minister dropped the hint on the occasion of the commissioning of completed research and development Projects and Inspection of ongoing ones at the National Metallurgical Development Centre (NMDC), Jos, yesterday. Reiterating the fact that Nigeria is endowed with abundant mineral resources, the minister affirmed that many of them were of the highest grade that requires less money to explore compared to other countries where they occur. “Indeed, as a result of the exploratory activities embarked upon by this administration, we have discovered newer and better occurrences of some of these minerals in previously unknown areas. “It is therefore clear that the policies and programmes embarked upon by the Muhammadu Buhari administration have taken the solid mineral sector to the next level. “We met a sector that is moribund due to neglect and poor funding, and through deliberate efforts, we have now revived it to make our mining environment competitive again,” he noted. He said the commissioning and inspection being carried out was part of efforts to ensure that in providing the enabling environment for investors as regulators, the ministry and its agencies must be equipped with the tools that would make them perform their roles adequately.
