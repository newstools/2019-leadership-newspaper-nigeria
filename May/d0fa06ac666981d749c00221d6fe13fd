Wife of the Ekiti State Governor, Erelu Bisi Fayemi has advised Nigerians to always take proactive steps against Cancer related diseases. She stated this during an event marking the 6th year remembrance of the former deputy governor of the state, Mrs Adunni Funmilayo Adunni Olayinka who died on April 6, 2013 after a long battle with cancer. Mrs Fayemi who lamented that many Nigerians are dying of the disease on daily basis urged women in particular to constantly go for breast and cervical cancer screening to guide against avoidable death. The first lady who preached against widespread negligence of early detection on the part of women and men said doctor’s prescription and treatment at first stage of breast cancer diagnosis must be sought. Mrs. Fayemi said, “We are using this medium to remember why Mrs. Adunni Olayinka passed on and this is why we are giving free healthcare services particularly on breast cancer to the women.  Because we believe that prevention is better than cure. “Breast cancer has four stages. It can be effectively treated in stages one and two. Third is bad, it is 50:50 chances fourth is very bad. Most women run away when doctors prescribed that the breast be removed. They rather go to seek for some religious help and waste time till the cancer gets to the worst stage of four when they run back to the hospital and it would have been too late for the doctor to rescue them.’’ She revealed that her husband, Governor Kayode Fayemi had graciously approved the women centre for all kinds of women empowerment and other humanitarian services for the women folk which will be held every three months. Also speaking, a consultant gynaecologist, Dr. Olumide Mojisola Ayomide, gave a comprehensive lecture on breast cancer for the women in attendance. She also educated the women on how to check their bodies for symptoms of breast cancer.
