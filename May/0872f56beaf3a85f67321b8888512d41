Oyo State governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, has assured workers of his administration’s resolve to pay the N30,000 minimum wage recently approved by President Muhammadu Buhari without delay. The governor said that the enhanced salaries would be paid to elevate the living condition of the workers as soon as the ongoing negotiations initiated by labour leaders with the government were concluded and documented. Speaking at this year’s May Day, the governor who was represented by his Deputy, Chief Moses Adeyemo, held at the Lekan Salami Sports Complex, Adamasingba, Ibadan, on Wednesday, thanked the workers for their dedication and support in the past eight years, the governor, saying they were the engine room of his administration’s successful implementation of its restoration, transformation and repositioning agenda. He used the occasion to assure workers affected by the recently-concluded certificate verification that those with genuine cases would be given a second opportunity to prove their innocence, stressing that those unable to defend their credentials would not be spared. Ajimobi said, “I congratulate the workers on the new minimum wage, which has just been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. “At the instance of the labour unions, government very recently held a meeting on the issue of the National Minimum Wage Law 2019, in furtherance of our responsibility as an employer of labour and indeed our exemplary government-labour relations. “I wish to restate the commitment of the government of Oyo State to honouring the Minimum Wage Act as soon as ongoing negotiations are concluded and necessary templates and documentation are issued. The State Chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade Emmanuel Ogundiran and his Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) counterpart, Comrade Bayo Titilola-Sodo, called on the government to be prepared to fulfil its side of the bargain on the new minimum wage as soon as talks were concluded.
