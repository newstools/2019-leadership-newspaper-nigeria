The immediate past minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, has said he learnt the dignity of silence and trust in the capacity of others from President Muhammadu Buhari while he served in his cabinet as a junior minister. He stated this at a valedictory ceremony held in his honour on Tuesday in Abuja. The event which took place at Minister’s Board Room on the 11th Floor of NNPC Towers, was attended by the permanent secretary, Dr. Folashade Yemi Esan, the directors, the heads of agencies of the Ministry, the Special Advisers and Technical Assistants of the Honourable Minister and a few others. Kachikwu who paid glowing tribute to President Buhari also expressed gratitude for the support he got from the staffs of the ministry and parastatals under the ministry. He attributed his acclaimed revolutionary achievements in the Oil and Gas sector of Nigeria to deliberate collegiate system of administration and not an achievement singly brought about. The former minister was reported to have pledged that pledged in or out of Government, he will always be around as a support voice and advocate for the best way to go in the Oil and Gas sector. Kachikwu also encouraged the heads of agencies to find ways of supporting the directors of the ministry and the permanent secretary as this is his panacea for productivity and progress of the sector, declaring that there is still lots of works to do to grow the sector. A statement issued by the head, press unit of the ministry, Oyetomi Olujimi, said one of the highlights of the valedictory event was a short documentary showcasing the 7 Big Wins which encompasses the thrust of Dr. Kachikwu’s administration of the Oil and Gas sector of the Nigerian economy. According to Olujimi, the former minister attributed most of the gains made by the ministry under his administration to the 7 Big Wins which Kachikwu said led to policies and transparency in the sector.
