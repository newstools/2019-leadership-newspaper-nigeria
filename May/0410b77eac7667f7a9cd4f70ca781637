Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode on Wednesday said for the first time in the political history of the state, his administration recorded four years of sustained industrial harmony in the state. Ambode, who spoke at the May Day rally, held at the Agege Stadium, Lagos with the theme, “Another 100 Years of Jobs, Dignity and Social Justice in Nigeria”, attributed the industrial harmony and peace in the State to the maturity and cooperation of the labour unions, applauding them for adopting alternative dispute resolution mechanisms rather than resort to industrial actions. The governor who was represented by the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Mr. Rotimi Ogunleye, said his administration since inception in May 2015, prioritised workers welfare and worked closely with union leaders to address policy and infrastructural issues, which according to him were the bane of effectiveness and efficiency of workers in the state. “Having devoted myself to these objectives for the past four years and, having worked with you all, I am glad to say that it has been a pleasure to be your partner on this journey. I am proud of what we have accomplished together, and I am grateful for the cooperation and support that you have given me. “Indeed, I am pleased that together, we have given the people of Lagos State four productive years of sustained industrial harmony. This is, perhaps, the longest period of such in the modern history of our State and this was made possible by the culture of mutual respect and understanding we nurtured and deployed. In his remarks, Chairman, Trade Union Congress (TUC), Lagos State Chapter, Comrade Francis Ogunremi commended Governor Ambode for his commitment to workers welfare in the last four years especially in areas of prompt payment of salary, allowances and timely remittance of workers’ pensions, describing him as one of the most labour-friendly Governors.
