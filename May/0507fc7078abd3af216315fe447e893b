An Ilorin Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday sentenced two men, Yusuf Kamarudeen and Chidi Mbanfo to six months imprisonment each for house breaking. Magistrate Olaolu Abayomi sentenced the duo after they pleaded guilty to charges of criminal conspiracy, house breaking and stealing. Abayomi, however, gave the convicts an options to pay N20,000 each as  fine. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Nasiru Yusuf, told the court  that the defendants broke into a Redeemed Church and made away with some musical instrument at Agbo Oba area, Ilorin. Yusuf said that the defendants were arrested at Kasmag Motor Park following information received from an authority in the church. He listed the stolen instruments as slave, mixer and keyboard which were all valued at N450, 000 but were recovered from the defendants. Yusuf said investigations revealed that the defendants were part of a syndicate that specialised in breaking into churches and  homes to steal valuables from their victims. He said the offences contravened Sections 97, 349 and 288 of the Penal Code Law. The Prosecutor had prayed the court to try the accused summarily since they pleaded guilty to the charges. (NAN)
