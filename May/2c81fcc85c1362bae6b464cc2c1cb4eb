Despite the formal invitation extended to the Emir of Kano by the inauguration Committee of Swearing in of Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje for the second tenure of office, the Royal father shuned the invitation. It could be recalled that the feud between the duo of Dr Ganduje and Emir Mahammadu Sanusi 11 has been lingering for sometimes leading to the balkanisation of the Kano Emirate Council into four Component units. LEADERSHIP observed that only the newly appointed Emirs of Bichi Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, Rano Alhaji Tafida AbubakarÂ  Illah and Karaye Dr Ibrahim Abubakar 11. and Emir of Gaya came. The swearing in ceremony was well attended by all the three Senators from Kano, Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Honourable Ado Alhassan Doguwa, members of the state House of Assembly led by the Speaker Honourable Kabiru Alhassan Rurum and thousands of party faithful.
