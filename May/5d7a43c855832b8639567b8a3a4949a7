Members of the Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Enugu branch of   the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) who were recently summarily dismissed and suspended have alleged that they were being victimised because of their involvement in union activities. It would be recalled that five officials of the union were dismissed recently while two were demoted by the governing council of the institution for allegedly committing some offences. The five dismissed officials were the chairman, general secretary, assistant general secretary, publicity secretary and financial secretary of the union. Addressing journalists in Enugu, the chairman of the ASUP in IMT, Comrade Ifesinachi Onuaguluchi said they were not guilty of the allegations leveled against them hence the need to reinstate them. He alleged that the management of the polytechnic decided to victimize them after they refused to call off the last national strike because they lacked the powers to do so since it was a national strike. Onuaguluchi noted that he has never been denied promotion in the Institute of Management and Technology, pointing out the same management that claimed to have dismissed him for committing some offences promoted him recently. According to him, there was no way that he would have been promoted if the offences they claimed he committed were in his file, accusing the management of speaking from both sides of the mouth. The embattled labor leader insisted that the management of the institution dismissed and demoted them because of their involvement in union activities
