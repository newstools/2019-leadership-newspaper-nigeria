Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s new baby boy is seventh in line to the British throne. The new baby bumps Prince Andrew, the second son of the Queen, into eighth place. But the youngster is behind his cousins Prince George and Princess Charlotte, by virtue of their father — Prince William — being older than Harry and second in line to the throne. The good news for the new baby is that its gender didn’t come into consideration in the line of succession, unlike in times gone by. In 2013, the U.K. Parliament passed a law allowing succession of siblings to be decided by age, rather than gender. The previous rules meant that an older sister would come further down the pecking order than her younger brother. The new baby also bumps Princess Eugenie, who got married last October, into tenth in line to the throne. Meghan Markle had gone into labour in the early hours of yesterday as royal fans desperately awaited news of her first child with Harry. The couple made the announcement on their Instagram account Meghan Harry yesterday “We are pleased to announce that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex welcomed their firstborn child in the early morning on May 6th, 2019. Their Royal Highnesses’ son weighs 7lbs. 3oz,” it said. Their royal highnesses have decided to keep details of the birth secret. Therefore, it is unknown if she is in hospital or at home – her preferred choice. The couple had previously announced their newborn would not be making his or her public appearance on its first day in the world, a step away from royal tradition. “The Duchess and baby are both healthy and well and the couple thank members of the public for their shared excitement and support during this very special time in their lives “More details will be shared in the forthcoming days.” Prince Harry was present in the hospital with the duchess at the time of delivery.
