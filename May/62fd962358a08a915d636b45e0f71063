African Alliance Insurance PLC has paid a sum of N1.8 billion claims to policyholders who suffered insured risks in the first quarter of 2019. This shows N300 million growth from N1.5 billion claims paid in the same quarter in 2018. Speaking on this development, managing director/CEO, African Alliance, Mrs. Funmi Omo, said her company recorded a 78 per cent increase in gross premium in first Quarter, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. She added that the insurance firm is in a strong financial position, and that the company’s recent investments and decisions back this. Omo stressed that the firm is determined to continue to grow its bottom-line organically, putting the interest of its customers and shareholders first as they remain germane to the existence of the firm. The company’s focus on digital transformation, according to her, will not only boost internal process efficiency but take the conversations to the customers on the digital channels for better customer experience. “Right now, a customer can take a policy from the comfort of their homes on our website or through social media. It does not get easier than this. Now, our customers do not have to stress themselves to protect their loved ones. The reward for their love is convenience,” she added. The company has also been active towards its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) including its recent activities where the team visited two public schools with gifts. To further demonstrate its commitment towards financial inclusion and its brand promise to protect the future of every Nigerian, the company recently embarked on a nationwide Takaful campaign aimed at spreading kindness nationwide. The campaign is a call to spread kindness and work together towards achieving life’s goals.
