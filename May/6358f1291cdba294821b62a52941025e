The Executive Director of the United States based International Association of African Authors and Scholars (IAAAS), Mr Chinedum Igwe has said the socio- economic growth and development of the African continent lies in the effective training of leaders who will take up the mantle of leadership. Igwe who made this assertion at the maiden edition of IAAAS Career Advancement and Leadership Skills Seminar said for Africa to get it right, new crop of leaders who will be selfless, committed and dedicated to the development of various countries in Africa need to be trained and given the right leadership perspective and mentoring that will impact their mindset positively. He emphasized that the training was in partnership with two universities in the USA ( Beulah Heights University and University of West Georgia), two great institutions who are ready to accept African students desirous to pursuitÂ  post-graduate programmes designed to enhance leadership training that will impact on organizational growth and nation-building in Africa Also speaking at the seminar, Franklin Obiagwu, a member of IAAAS and motivational speaker said the issue of lack of good leadership has been the bane of the African continent. In his presentation, he itemized several factors responsible for poor leadership in the African continent. Amongst the factors he identified were the issues of excessive greed and endemic corruption which have contributed immensely in stunting the growth of the continent. For the upcoming leaders, Franklin Obiagwu, said such leaders must be ready to shun corruption and greed, adding that they should embrace the virtue of selfless service and a genuine desire to serve their organization, community and their countries.
