Ogun State Governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun on Wednesday approved the immediate payment of all outstanding salary deductions of the state’s workforce running to between 18 and 23 months. Amosun has also directed the full payment of the workers’ salary for the month of April 2019 which he said runs to over N20. 2 billions without any deduction. The governor made the announcement while delivering his speech at the year 2019 Workers’ Day celebration held at the M.K.O Abiola International Stadium, Abeokuta, the state capital. He explained that decision for the approval of the payment was in consonant with his earlier promise that his administration will not leave the state without paying all the workers’ salary deductions which included cooperatives, check-off dues, Christmas and “Ileya shillings”. Amosun assured that members of the state workforce would by today (Thursday), begin to receive bank alerts confirming payments of the money, while their statutory leave balance would follow latest seven days after, while gratuity will be paid up till year 2018. He also hinted that he has given approval for the release of the workers’ promotion from year 2015 till year 2017. Amosun explained that the delay experienced in the release and payments of the deductions and allowances was as a result of the need to also pay the pensioners their entitlements on monthly basis. The governor however, told the workers not to expect settlements of their contributory pensions, stressing that it was beyond him. Speaking earlier, chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Comrade Olubunmi Fajobi pleaded with the governor to evolve a system that would allow workers in the state who, in the course of service, obtained additional professional qualification to enjoy career growth beyond Grade Level 14.
