Danish shipping giant Maersk is to accelerate growth in its Logistics & Services sector through further integration. The company said that its APM Terminals Inland Services would be integrated into Maersk Logistics & Services from August 1, 2019. The company’s Inland Services portfolio is a network of inland terminals around the globe consisting of 36 business units with over 100 locations. “APM Terminals can fully focus on becoming a world-class port operator, while Maersk, with the integration of Inland Services, will continue to focus on ocean transportation as well as logistics and services product development and delivery,” Søren Toft, EVP and Chief Operating Officer A.P. Moller – Maersk, said. APM Terminals will continue to serve shipping line and landside customers with services on and around the port premises such as traditional storage and terminal handling as well as newly developed services such as fast-gates. While focusing on its core offering, APM Terminals is also continuing to collaborate with Maersk for customers who are looking for end-to-end solutions. “The even closer collaboration enables both APM Terminals and Maersk to reduce complexity and eliminate service overlaps, so that both brands can focus on their core strengths and provide greater value and a better experience to customers,” Morten Engelstoft, CEO APM Terminals and EVP A.P. Moller – Maersk, said.
