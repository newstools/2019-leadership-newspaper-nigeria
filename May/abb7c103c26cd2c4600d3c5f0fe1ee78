The value of the naira had been stable on all the various markets selling at N360 to the dollar on the streets and at Bureau de Change end of the market as the CBN continued to manage demand with its interventions in the foreign exchange market. Analysts believe that the sustained increase in foreign portfolio buying interest in the fixed income market is largely responsible for the accretions to the reserves although stable oil prices and output have continued to favour increased forex earnings. The CBN in continuance of its weekly sales, last week, injected $205 million into the market to support the currency. The wholesale segment of the market was offered $100 million while the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) segment received $55 million.
