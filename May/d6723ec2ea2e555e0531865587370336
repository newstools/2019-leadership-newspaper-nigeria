The Executive Unique Club of Nigeria has advocated stiff penalties against child-trafficking in the country to end the manace and to serve as a deterrent to others. This was just as the club has appealed to couples to engage in child-spacing and family planning to limit the number of their children to as much as the can comfortably take care-of. President of the club, Unique Vitus Amanze, stated this while speaking to newsmen after a public engagement in Afaraukwu-Ibeku, in Umuahia North Local Government Area. He harped on the need for governments at all levels to carry out aggressive campaigns and sensitization exercises of the general public on the negative effects of child trafficking. He said, “There should be enough sensitization exercise from the governments of parents especially mothers and the society at large on the negative effect of the menace.” He further called for an improved standard of education and door to door sensitization exercise to reduce to its barest minimum cases of girl-child pregnancy and unwanted pregnancies. Similarly, a member of the club, Unique Ihunnaya Onuoha listed some of the major causes of child-deliquence to include poor and weak background, indiscipline, ignorance and lack of parental care. He pointed out that due to financial realities today, most parents hardly fend for their children, which negatively affect the child, as “they end up in most cases being street urchins”. Unique Onuoha appealed to parents and guardians to strive to train and inculcate socially acceptable manners in their children and wards to make reliable members of the society. At the occasion, the Archdeacon/Vicar of St. Andrew’s Anglican Church in the community, Ven. Godfrey C. Martins advised parents and guardians to bring up their children and wards in Godly way
