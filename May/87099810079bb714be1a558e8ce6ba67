Muslims will on Monday commence the annual Ramadan fast following the sighting of the moon. The National Moon Sighting Committee (NMSC) and Lagos State Moon Sighting Committee (LMSC) in a statement said Saturday 28th was the last day of Sha’ban, 1440 and not 29th as assumed. They said new crescent (hilal) was born on Saturday 4th of May, 2019 (28th of Sha’ban) at 11: 45pm (after sunset), meaning that it was impossible to sight the new crescent on Saturday at sunset (6:55pm). For the new crescent to be sighted, the committees argued that it needs about 15.15hrs-17hrs or more. Thus, they claimed Sunday 5th of May, 2019 (29th of Sha’ban) was the first day to search for the new crescent. “Crescent can only be sighted after sunset. So, if the crescent is reportedly sighted tomorrow (Sunday, 5th of May), then Monday 6th of May will be the first day of Ramadan, 1440. “Note that Ramadan cannot start on Sunday 5th of May, and any reports on the moon being sighted on Saturday, 4th of May should be rejected”, they said. Also, the moon was not sighted in Saudi Arabia on Saturday, hence, the taraweeh (night prayers) had commenced on Sunday night, while the 1st Ramadan 1440 will commence on Monday, 6th May, 2019.
