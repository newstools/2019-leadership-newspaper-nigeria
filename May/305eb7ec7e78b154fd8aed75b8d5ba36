Relations between Nigeria and Israel will soon receive a boost as the country’s Prime Minister, Mr Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuvin Rivlin, are set to visit Nigeria. Ahead of the planned visit, the federal government has invited Netanyahu to attend Nigeria’s Democracy Day celebration on June 12, 2019. If Netanyahu comes to Nigeria, it will be 61 years the last time an Israeli prime minister came to Nigeria in 1958. The Israeli prime minister’s proposed visit was revealed in Abuja yesterday by the country’s Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Shimon Ben-Shosan. Ben-Shosan said that Israel would also want President Muhammadu Buhari to visit his country in return because the visit by the two leaders would be “historic.” The envoy spoke at the presidential villa, Abuja, when he presented his Letters of Credence to Buhari. The ambassador did not say whether Netanyahu would honour the invitation, but he spoke of the enduring bilateral relations between Nigeria and Israel. Ben-Shosan said: ‘‘Next year will be 60 years of diplomatic relations between Nigeria and Israel, and the last time a prime minister of Israel visited Nigeria was in 1958. ‘‘My dream is to bring my prime minister and president to visit Nigeria and for President Buhari to visit Israel. That will be historic for us,” he added.
