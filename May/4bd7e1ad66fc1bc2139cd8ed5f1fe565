The National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, has appealed to the federal and state governments to put structures in place to tackle the rising population of out-of-school children in the country. The association which puts the figure of  out of school children at 10.2 million in the country, urged the government to make grants-in-aid available to private school owners to enable them to work towards reducing the number. Speaking at a cultural carnival at the National Stadium Abuja, NAPPS chairperson, Mrs Lilian Ogujiofor, noted that the association shares the government’s concern over the rising population of out-of-school children in the country and in the FCT in particular. At the occasion where over 3,000 pupils marched to commemorate the Children’s Day celebration, Ogujiofor said, “As loyal citizens and core stakeholders in the country’s education sector, we share the government’s concern for the rising population of out-of-school children in the country and in the FCT in particular.” She stated further that “ Government should understand that the body of private school educators is very crucial to the advancement of education in Nigeria and these schools should not be treated by the government as mere profit-making establishments. “The schools should not be taxed and levied like other commercial ventures. “This problem has made private schools exorbitant and inaccessible to majority of children of school age whose parents are underprivileged. “We therefore call on the FCT administration to make grants-in-aid available to the private schools on the basis of enrolment figure, as obtained in the First Republic before the takeover of schools in all states in 1970.” LEADERSHIP reports that children were drawn from schools in the Abuja Municipal Area Council at the occasion.
