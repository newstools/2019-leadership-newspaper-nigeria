The founder of One Love Family, Sat Guru Maharaj Ji has warned against post electoral rancour in the country, saying unguarded utterances being made by politicians over the last general election in the country could endanger the nation’s democracy. Maharaj Ji in a statement made available to journalists urged the winner of the 2019 presidential election, President Muhammed Buhari and the aggrieved, Alhaji Abubakar Atiku to place the survival and success of Nigeria above personal considerations in the course of the litigation over the electoral defeat. According to him, the nation’s much awaited 2019 presidential election has been concluded and a winner has emerge, noting that the way the mood of the candidate who contested against the incumbent surprisingly went sour seems to threaten peace in the country. He said Buhari’s victory over Atiku transcends inter-party rivalry and any personal political interest thinkable. “Nigeria has been highly traumatized for many years. Our country is in need of healing without delay. No right thinking Nigerian politician will deny the fact that Nigeria’s obviously dilapidated state is a colossal national disgrace that must rank high in importance above all sectional and narrow interests.
