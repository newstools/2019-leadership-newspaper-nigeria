The governor, who was represented by the commissioner for Environment of Bayelsa State, Ebipadei Apaingolo, condemned  the multinational oil firms for brazenly destroying the Niger Delta environment without adherence to international best practices in their activities. Dickson commended Rotary International for deeming it fit to recognise the activities of his administration with a highly prestigious award especially on issues relating to environment as it affects the people of the state. The governor who reiterated  his commitment in fighting environmental degradation, noted that the launch of Rise For Bayelsa Campaign was an initiative aimed at attracting global attention to the ravaging effects of oil spills, pollution and environmental degradation in the state. The governor, therefore, sought the partnership of the Rotary International and other groups, locally and internationally in his quest to address the Environmental challenges confronting the people of Niger Delta region.
