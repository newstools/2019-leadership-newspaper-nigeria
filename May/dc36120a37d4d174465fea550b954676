The family of a suspect, (identified simply as Ikenga) declared wanted by the Nigeria Police Force for receiving stolen vehicles and resisting arrest, has denied aiding the suspect escape when the police came for him. The spokesman of Ikenga’s family, Mr Inaku Adaoluohu, at the weekend, said there was need for proper clarification on the incident that happened in Cross River state. Concerning the vehicle in question, Adaoluohu said “Ikenga bought the vehicle from a guy identified as ‘biggy’ from Gboko, Benue State, at the cost of N1.4 million. The said biggy has been using the vehicle for commercial purpose in Gboko for more than three months before selling it out. “Ikenga equally bought the vehicle and sold it immediately to one Augustine Araki about a month and one week before the incident. One thing should be made clear, the police never went to Ikenga’s house neither did they disclose that they neither were policemen nor put on anything to show they were police. “Secondly, the Ogoja Area Command and the Okuku Division Police when initially contacted confirmed that they had no knowledge of police deployment within their jurisdiction which means they may not have registered their presence in these places which is expected of them. “These police formations will have at least assisted them in carrying out the task smoothly without resorting to this kind of unnecessary use of commando approach.” Adaoluohu also explained that Ikenga grew up in Okuku community and has been living his life with family members and doing his cattle rearing and selling business over the years. He also noted that the said Ikenga was kidnapped by unknown Gunmen something last year, who tortured him brutally leaving him with life threatening injuries before he regained freedom after his family paid huge amount of money as ransom. Recall that Police had declared Ikanga wanted after they claimed some villagers had aided him to escape arrest for receiving stolen vehicles.
