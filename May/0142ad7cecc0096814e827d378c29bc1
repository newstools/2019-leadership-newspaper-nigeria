The federal government is set to flag-off the commencement of cargo delivery by rail to the Kaduna Inland Dry Port. The programme scheduled to hold tomorrow at the facilities premises in Kakuri, Kaduna state would have in attendance the governor of Kaduna State, Mallam, Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai and the Minister of Transportation,  Rotimi Amaechi, who would flag-off the service. Speaking ahead of the program, the executive secretary and CEO, Nigerian Shippers Council, Bar. Hassan Bello, said the connecting of the railway to the dry port is a watershed to the facility. He said the rail facility would lead to the full optimisation of the Kaduna inland dry port, adding that it would also drive down significantly the cost of transporting containers from Lagos to Kaduna. “So much cargo is coming to Kaduna now but on trucks. It takes so much money to transport goods by trucks from Lagos to Kaduna. If it is by rail, the cost will drop by over 60 percent,” he said. He also said transporting containers by railway would also eliminate the risks of diversion, goods tampering and also reduce the risks of accidents by over 95 per cent , thus driving down the cost if insuring cargo to Kaduna as a point of entry. A statement signed by Tahir Idris of the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), the promoters of the dry ports across the country, said the Council would also hold an interactive session with all relevant stakeholders immediately after the event. Bello also noted that with reduced cost of transporting the goods, the cost of goods would reduce and this would in turn curb inflation.
