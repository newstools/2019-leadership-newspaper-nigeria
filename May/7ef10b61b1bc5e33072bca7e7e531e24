Stakeholders in the rail sector have called on management of Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) to erect level crossing barriers at all railway level crossings in order to regulate movement of traffic and avert the incessant deaths recorded at railway level crossings in the country. The call is coming against the backdrop of the recent death of four passengers killed by an Ijoko to Iddo bound Lagos Mass Transit train inside a tricycle at Iju railway level crossing. According to a regular commuter of the Lagos Mass Transit Train service, Mr John Obot, the employment of flagmen to regulate traffic at railway level crossings is not enough to avert the unnecessary deaths recorded at regular intervals at railway level crossings. He advised management of the corporation to erect metal barriers that could be lowered to regulate traffic whenever a train is approaching. Obot noted that when the Rail India Technical and Engineering Services (RITES) of India managed the corporation in late 70’s and early 80’s metal barriers were erected at both sides of the road to stop traffic whenever trains were approaching level crossings, adding that during that period there were few cases of trains killing motorists at railway level crossings. Managing Director, First Rit Nigeria Limited, a Transport and Logistics Company, Mr. Eric Umezurike said the claim by officials of NRC that the communities, local and state governments where rail lines intersects with roads should be responsible for maintenance of such level crossings is not tenable because the corporation generates revenue from the passenger and goods train services it operates. The Lagos District Manager, of the corporation Engr. Jerry Oche had said in an interview that most of the metal barriers used to regulate traffic at railway level crossings were damaged by motorists out of restlessness and disobedience.
