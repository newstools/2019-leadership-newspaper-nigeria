Household company, Hayat Kimya Holdings, recently launched two new products, the Molped Sanitary Pad and Molfix Pants. The unveiling of the products was done alongside the unveiling of music artiste, Chidinma Ekile, as Molped sanitary pad celebrity ambassador at the Eko Hotel and Suites. The ceremony, which had over 600 attendees including Hayat Kimya global vice presidents and directors, trade partners, global staff and business partners, was hosted by Zainab Balogun Nwachukwu and Teju Babyface Oyelakin. The new brand ambassador expressed her view on the new products and what it means to Nigerian customers. “Nigerian consumers, especially myself, have been dissatisfied with the kind of sanitary pad brands available to us most of which gives us unpleasant reactions from using them. Reactions like itching, heat irritations and especially leakages were top on our complain list. So it was interesting to be approached by Hayat Kimya a brand known for making exceptionally good products, from their diapers to everyday toiletries. It will be great not to worry about leakages when performing on stage.” MOLFIX, as a brand, continues to strive to provide happiness for both mother and child. The company’s global marketing director, Ertunga Kut, in his speech, enumerated the company’s achievement since coming to Nigeria. “Since coming to Nigeria in 2015, we have kept on growing in leaps and bounds. Nigeria and Nigerians carry special importance in the growth potential for Hayat Kimya in strategic locations in West and Central Africa.”
