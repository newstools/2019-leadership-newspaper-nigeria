A student of the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Abdul Majid Iliyasu Gita, has won a brand-new Hyundai at the grand finale of 9mobiles Northern Promo. Receiving his prize at 9mobiles Experience Centre at the Ado Bayero Shopping Mall, Kano, Gita, who hails from Bauchi State, said that 9mobile has changed his life with the brand-new car. The undergraduate disclosed that he never thought he would own a car, but as destiny would have it, he participated in the promo that started in February and eventually emerged as the winner of the star prize at the grand finale. Gita said, “It is a precious feeling for me to be so honoured by 9mobile. Words alone won’t express how I’m feeling right now. 9mobile has succeeded in changing my life with a brand-new Hyundai and I will always be grateful to them.” Presenting the prize to the star winner, head, Regional Sales, 9mobile, Babangida Mukkadas said the telco embarked on the significant journey of rewarding its loyal customers to secure their socio-economic advancement with the promo. He said the raffle draw was done electronically to ensure objectivity in the emergence of winners, thereby giving room for healthy competition among 9mobiles customers. Mukkadas further revealed that 9mobile would continue to present such opportunities to its customers, adding that those who did not partake in this promo can do so in subsequent editions.
