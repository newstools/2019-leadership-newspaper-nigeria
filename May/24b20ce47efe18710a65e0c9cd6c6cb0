WhatsApp users can now send and receive Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) via the popular messaging platform thanks to the Lite.Im bot. A newly-released bot from this crypto messaging service is the latest attempt to simplify the cryptocurrency transaction process, bringing virtual currencies closer to the everyday person. The popular mobile messaging platform is owned by Facebook that has been rumored to release its own crypto alongside a new payment service that would integrate with the app. Just for reminder, Facebook said they would integrate cryptocurrency payments across its messaging services. This includes three of Facebook’s wholly owned apps – Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The service also allows people to earn cryptocurrency via a referral program. There are also options that allow users to set their default coin, as well as select their preferred language and password. Presently, the two default languages are English and Spanish.
