The Kano State Public Complaint Commission and Anti-corruption Commission has invited Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II’s uncles and brother for questioning over alleged financial misconduct. Those invited are his two uncles, Isa Sanusi Bayero and Mannir Sanusi Bayero, who is the Chief of Staff of the Emirate Council; his brother, Danburan Mujitaba, who is the Falaki of Kano and, the Accountant of the Council, Muhammad Sani Kwaru. They were to give explanations for alleged misappropriation of Emirate Council’s funds to the anti-graft agency. A letter of invitation sent to the Emirate Council’s officials stated that “the allegation violates Section 26 of the Commission’s Enabling Law, in the management of Kano State Emirate Council funds, covering the period of 2013 to 2017.” Those invited were alleged to either have knowledge of the allegation against the Emirate Council, or have allegedly participated in the act. LEADERSHIP recalls that similar allegations of financial misappropriation had been leveled against Kano Emirate Council in the past.
