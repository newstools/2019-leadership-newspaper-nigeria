Nigeria through the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the regulator of the oil and gas industry, is seeking cooperation of South Africa to develop its gas sector which is currently worth $50 billion. Conveying the invitation to South Africa in Lagos at the Nigeria – South Africa Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting, the director of DPR, Mr. Ladan Modecai, explained that his action was ignited by the conviction that there is prospect for gas in Nigeria beyond its shores. He disclosed that such investment prospects abound in the development of upstream gas fields with a total of 37.4 trillion cubic feet, Trans-Nigeria gas pipeline project, Gas Revolution Industrial Park at Ogidigben FTZ, three power plants for additional 3.2GW capacity, licencing and establishment of several modular refineries. Others are: collocating a refinery within Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company, rehabilitation/upgrade of the refineries, revamp of Liquefied Petroleum Gas and building of new CNG plants across the country as well as pipeline and storage tank construction. The DPR’s boss, who was represented by its deputy manager, gas exploration and production, Joseph Ogunsola, said Nigeria must leverage its gas potentials to enlarge the national cake for sustainable development of the country. He said: “The National Gas Policy, Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme and Gas Network Code are key enablers in charting our path towards Optimum Gas Development and Gas-Based Industrialisation. Most of the erstwhile constraints are being addressed in a holistic manner through government policies, reforms, and gas monetisation drive. In his remarks, country manager, Nigeria, Sasol Chemicals, Oscar Mdluli, emphasized the need for Nigeria to make the abundance of its gas potential centerpiece of its economic growth. He also lauded the roles the DPR is playing in repositioning the country’s gas sector.
