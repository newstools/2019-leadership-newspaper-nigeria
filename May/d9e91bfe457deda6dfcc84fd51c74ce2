Two of the kidnappers died from injuries sustained during exchange of gun fire with the Police in the course of the rescue mission; and 22 other kidnap victims were rescued in Zamfara state and other parts of the country. In addition, between January 2019 and the 1st week of May, 2019, a total of 270 suspected kidnappers were arrested, 275 suspected armed robbers were arrested and 105 assorted weapons plus a large cache of ammunition recovered.
