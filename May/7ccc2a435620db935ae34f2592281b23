***Says it has not endorsed any aspirant yet The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Sunday declared that lawmakers elected under its platform in National Assembly, who are qualified and popular to hold office as presiding officers of both chambers of the National Assembly, in line with the constitution. The party however said its leadership and elected federal legislators have not taken any official position on who to lend support for the position of presiding officers of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The PDP national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party’s position is predicated on reports in a section of the media suggesting that its members-elect in the House of Representatives have settled for a particular aspirant as the new Speaker. Ologbondiyan in a statement said “The PDP is still consulting with its members-elect and no official position has been taken on the issue, particularly as the positions of presiding officers are not exclusive preserve of the ruling party or any other party for that matter, but a constitutional right of every elected lawmaker in their respective chambers. “Moreover, the PDP has an array of elected lawmakers, in both chambers, who are eminently qualified and equally popular among their colleagues, across the divide, to hold office as presiding officers of both chambers of the National Assembly, in line with Section 50 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). “What is important to Nigerians is the emergence of a purposeful leadership that will ensure accountability and good governance in the polity.” The PDP while noting its committment to the wellbeing of the nation, stressed that it will remain focused in its determination to rescue the nation “from incompetent system”. It therefore urged Nigerians to discountenance such reports suggesting that PDP lawmakers have settled for a particular aspirant for any presiding office in the National Assembly.
