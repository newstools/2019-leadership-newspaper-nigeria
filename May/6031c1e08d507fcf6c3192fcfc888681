The Nigerian Army has banned the use of motorcycles in Zamfara, Kano Katsina,Sokoto, Kaduna, Kebbi and Niger States where Exercise Harbin Kunama is currently ongoing to tackle kidnapping and banditry. The Acting Director Army Public Relations Col Sagir Musa said the Army has observed over time that armed bandits, kidnappers and their collaborators use motorcycles to perpetrate their activities hence the ban on motorcycles around the forests. “The Nigerian Army (NA) over time has observed the use of motorcycles by armed bandits, kidnappers, criminal elements and their collaborators as enablers to perpetrate their heinous crimes especially in the states within the north west geopolitical zone of the country/ “This informed the decision and directive to ban the use of motorcycles within the hinterland particularly around the Forests where the armed bandits, criminals and kidnappers hibernate and all around where troops are conducting operations alongside other security agencies,” he said He explained that while banned may cause some inconveniences to some law abiding citizens in the area, there is need to use all means possible to stop the dastardly activities of these bandits across the North Western part of the country. He therefore called on the general public, particularly in the North West and some parts of North Central in Nigeria where Exercise Harbin Kunama is ongoing to bear with the NA as concerted efforts are being made to combat the insecurity within the area. “In this wise, it is hereby reiterated that the use of motorcycles remain banned within the forest areas in Kano, Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kaduna, Kebbi and Niger States. “Anyone caught using motorcycles within the named areas will be taken for an armed bandit, criminal and kidnapper with dire consequences,” He further enjoined governments of the affected states  communicate the ban on the use of motorcycles in the named areas and enforce the ban in conjunction with the Security Agencies.
