The Nigerian equities market yesterday dwindled by 0.48 per cent on sustained bearish run for the third consecutive trade session, this week. The All Share Index (ASI) fell by 136.68 points or 0.48 per cent to 28,286.08 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation shed N51 billion to close at N10.627 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Forte Oil, Cement Company of Nigeria (CCNN), Dangote Flour Mills, Dangote Cement and Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN). Analysts at APT Securities and Funds Limited expected “Further moderation of the ASI as foreign investors remain on the side-lines in the absence of major economic triggers. However, to be diluted by value investors positioning for long term.” While analysts at Afrinvest Limited anticipated a possible rebound before close of the week as investors buy the dip for fundamental stocks with attractive entry prices.
