The Lagos State Police Public Relations (PPRO) Bala Elkana, a Deputy Superintendent of Police in a statement said the attention of the Command has been drawn to a video being circulated on the social media in respect of an Okada Rider said to have been chased to his death by a Police Office. According to him, the allegation is false and a complete misrepresentation of the facts. He explained that on 8th, May 2019 at about 6.05am the Police at Ago Okota Police Station heard a loud sound few meters away from the station and rushed out to ascertain what was going on. “They found a motorcyclist in the pool of his own blood with his motorcycle on the ground. The victim was taken to the hospital but eventually died”. Bala, said “On inquiries from eye witnesses around the scene gathered that the motorcyclist was involved in a fatal accident with a vehicle along Ago Palace way. “An eye witness known as Mr. Adedayo Benson stated that this morning he was standing in front of century hotel and saw the okada man, who was riding on a high speed ran into a road bump/speed breaker and suddenly applied his break but was hit by a Camry car who was driving behind. “That the driver of the Camry ran before the arrival of the Police and escaped.” He said investigation into the accident is ongoing to track and apprehend the driver of the Camry vehicle with a view of bringing him to justice.
