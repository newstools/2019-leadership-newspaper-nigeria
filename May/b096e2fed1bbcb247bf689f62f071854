The Society of Women Accountants of Nigeria (SWAN) has trained students of Nasarawa State University, Keffi (NSUK) on basic accounting skills in order to help them become successful entrepreneurs. The workshop featured paper presentations on the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) professional examination, Effects of Drug Abuse on the Youth and motivational interactive session with students. Chairperson of SWAN, Mrs Ijeoma Ugwunebo, who spoke in Keffi recently during the workshop themed: “Catch Them Young,” said the programme was aimed at catching students who have dreams in the accounting profession at a young age to grow the respect to their chosen career and their attitudes towards their career so that they can make positive impacts to their lives and become responsible members of the Nigerian society. She charged the undergraduates in the accounting discipline to take advantage of the opportunity while still in school and to enroll in the professional examinations and the accounting technician skill so that upon their graduation they might have already become members of the accounting profession. According to her, the workshop became necessary in order to equip students with the basic skills of becoming successful entrepreneurs. “We educate the students on the need to start pursuing their professional qualifications early and choose ICAN because of the value of the certificate.” She noted that earning ICAN certificate would opens doors to a wide range of career opportunities in all areas of industry, commerce, finance and manufacturing sectors both locally and internationally and also allows them to specialise in a technical aspect of accountancy such as corporate recovery, forensic accountancy, corporate finance or taxation.
