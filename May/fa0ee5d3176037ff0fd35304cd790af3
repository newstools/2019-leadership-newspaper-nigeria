Outlook for the week In the new week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expected “The local equities market to close marginally in green territory amid announcement of the re-appointment of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor by President Buhari and the readiness signalled by MTN Nigeria to list on the local bourse, given the registration of its 20 billion shares with Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). Hence, we feel investors would take advantage of the low share prices to maximize their returns.”
