The President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration has increased the funding for capital projects by the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) with N50 billion allocated each for the 2017 and 2018 budgets for the development of critical infrastructure in the zones. Acting managing director of the agency, Mr Terhembe Nongo, made this disclosure in Abuja. Nongo informed that before now, the agency got only a paltry N2billion. According to him, following the unprecedented capital votes, infrastructural transformation, renewal and upgrading has started in the Calabar Free Trade Zone as well as Kano Free Trade Zone which are two federal government- owned free trade zones. “We may not  be where we wanted to be  at this time,but we are certainly not where we started.And with the renewed interest in NEPZA,particularly in terms  of enhanced  budgetary allocation,NEPZA is set to take the scheme to the next level,” he said. Nongo further revealed that after 25 years,the federal government has commenced moves to review NEPZA’s mandate to make it become an industrial development agency by facilitating the development, promotion, operation,  regulation and marketing of industrial clusters, industrial cities, industrial parks and free zones across the country. Nongo said this was based on the recently – launched Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) policy document. On the challenges facing the agency, Nongo highlighted the issue of poor state of roads as well as the absence of a functional rail system and inland waterways that had made the transportation of finished goods from the zones to the ports for exports difficult and under-funding which has, in turn, affected the quality of infrastructure in the zones. While acknowledging that the review of the NEPZA Act which is before the national assembly was another major challenge, Nongo observed that interagency rivalry, a poor appreciation of the free zone innovation by the generality of the people, insecurity etc remain teething issues to be solved.
