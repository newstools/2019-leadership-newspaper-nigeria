The Human Development Initiatives, a non -governmental organization, has called on Lagos state government to make public schools in the state more inclusive to accommodate children with disabilities. The Project Coordinator of HDI, Samuel Ajayi told LEADERSHIP during an awareness walk to the office of the Lagos state governor that special needs school is being phased out, saying it is high time government invested in infrastructure that would enable children irrespective of their disability to learn together. He said the walk which is part of activities to mark the Global Action Week on Education themed, “Making the Right to an Inclusive, Equitable, Quality, Free Public Education a Reality” is a call for inclusive education such “that all children irrespective of their disability have the right to learn with their peers. “We are calling the attention of the government to the need to promote and support quality inclusive free public education for all children because the right to education is a right of every child. ‘’So government must invest and prioritize education and make sure that the quality of education is of the standard that can raise the future and better the lives of all children especially the marginalized ones. “All barriers to making this difficult must be removed so there is no issue of special needs school. All children have the capacity to learn together if only all the barriers are removed. “If all the necessary infrastructure and aid facilities are equipped in our schools, all children can learn. It has been experimented in developed countries of the world and it can be done here if our government is committed to making this work. “Special needs school is a step towards inclusion it is not an end. Special need school era is fading away and it has been proven that children now can learn together with their peers regardless of disabilities.”
