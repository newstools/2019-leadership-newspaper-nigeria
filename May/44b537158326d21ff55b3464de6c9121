With a solid, positive and growing set of results across the board, LaLiga said it has achieved the best figures in the competition’s history in 2018 with a revenue of €4.479 billion. According to the financial report to the latest complete season of 2017/2018, LaLiga’s clubs posted revenue of €4.479 billion, representing growth of 20.6 er cent over the previous season. Speaking to media, yesterday in Lagos at an interactive session on the company’s financial performance for the 2017/2018 season, La Liga delegate in Nigeria, Guillermo Castello said this is the largest positive annual change in recent years. He said it was particularly notable given that it occurred following several financial years in which it has been consistently posting double-digit growth rates and in which, furthermore, we are at the midway point of the three-year audiovisual cycle for the national market. LaLiga’s gross operating profit (EBITDA) stood at €945 million, an increase of 20.7 per cent, operating profit (EBIT) up by 11.4 per cent €325 miion, and the net profit for the year was €189 million. Castello said that the company produced a solid, positive and growing set of results across the board, achieving the best figures in the competition’s history. According to him, the 2017/18 season was surprising due to two new drivers of LaLiga’s growth breaking onto the scene, commercial revenue and revenue from transfers, which have seized the central role held by broadcasting revenues as drivers of annual growth. “In the case of commercial revenue, the annual increase was 34.1 per cent, amounting to turnover of €838 million, which is indicative of the fact that Spanish clubs are becoming an increasingly attractive medium for sponsors.” The president of LaLiga, Javier Medrano said that the latest financial year has turned out to be of particular significance for a number of reasons.
