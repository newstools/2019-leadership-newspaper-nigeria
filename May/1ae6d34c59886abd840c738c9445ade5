The Small – scale Consultative Forum, Abuja branch, has commended the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and its acting registrar-general, Lady Azuka Azinge, for what it called the life-touching reforms she has so far introduced in the commission since assuming office in 2017. The body in a communiqué released to journalists and signed by Mr Komolafe Jameel, and Pius Ekong, president and secretary of the forum respectively, at end of its annual business appraisal meeting in Abuja during the weekend, noted that CAC under the watch of Lady Azinge has made Nigerian small-scale businesses, that were before now, not given much consideration to become positioned to contribute to national economy. According to the communiqué, “Opening up and deepening communication with stakeholders and the general public through open market sensitisation , customers’ fora, coupled with the sensitisation of micro, small and medium scale enterprises(MSMEs) and other associations through the media, has brought about more robust way of doing business in the country.” It added that it was through this means that the commission was able to implement the Business Incentive Strategy (BIS) through which members of the forum were allowed to register their business names at discounted rate of N5, 000 which represented half of the normal filing fees for business names. While commending the Azinge and her team for implementing 24-hour service delivery timeline for pre-incorporation applications for overall efficiency, the communiqué is of the opinion that, sustaining the online operations which have made it possible to discard manual operations in the commission, would continue to boost businesses of its members, which had tripled to an unprecedented level with the coming on board of Lady Azinge at the CAC. The communiqué also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for creating a conducive environment for small – scale businesses to thrive in the country.
