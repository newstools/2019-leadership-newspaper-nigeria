Workers in Zamfara State have been warned against taking advantage of the new minimum wage to insert new names in the payroll. Giving the warning yesterday at the May Day celebration, Governor Abdulaziz Yari said that only genuine workers in the payroll would enjoy the new minimum wage. Yari who spoke through the secretary to the state government, Prof. Abdullahi Shinkafi said insertion of additional names would not be acceptable. “It will  be unfair and unjust for the civil servants to put new names in the payroll, especially, wives and children,” he added. According to him, efforts were being put in place to settle the backlog of gratuities before leaving office and that he would be the first to pay the N30,000 minimum wage to workers in the state. He then urged the workers to give maximum support to the government and block all leakages. In his speech, the chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in the state, Comrade Bashir Mafara urged workers to reciprocate the gesture of the government. “With the new minimum wage workers ought to redouble efforts to duty by being prompt and punctual”, he added. Mafara however, appealed to the state government to redeem its promises to workers and pensioners in the state.
