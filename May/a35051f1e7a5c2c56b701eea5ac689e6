A mob in Kawo area of Kaduna North local government area of Kaduna State yesterday set ablaze one of the two suspected kidnappers caught in the area. The angry youths in the community also protested against the police for allegedly killing a trader who was among those chasing the kidnappers. Trouble started when residents heard that some kidnappers were about to abduct some people in Sabon Kawo and immediately blocked the roads leading in and out of the area. They apprehended two of the suspects and set one of them ablaze with unused tyres. Upon receiving the information, the police mobilised to the scene and in an attempt to disperse the crowd and rescue the surviving suspect, shot sporadically into the air and killed one person, leaving several others injured. The protesters, who sang Bazaamu Yarda Ba meaning “we won’t take this from the police” burnt tyres, placed shrapnels and logs of woods on the highway from Kaduna to Zaria and Birnin-Gwari. They prevented human and vehicular movement, insisting that the other kidnapper in police custody must be released to them to face justice. They also demanded justice for the slain soap seller. The Kaduna State police command condemned the action of the mob and vowed to deal decisively with the culprits. The police public relations officer, Yakubu Sabo, said that the residents acted on a false alarm raised by one Alhaji Musa. He said that Musa who deals in oil had a problem with one of his partners who reported the matter to the police in Lagos State and was invited and detained.
