Hours after hosting the Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas for the second consecutive year, Clarkson cut her celebrations short and underwent surgery to get her appendix removed. The “Broken & Beautiful” singer, 37, confirmed the news in a tweet on Thursday, explaining that she had “broken down in tears after the show from pain” and immediately flew back home once the awards show wrapped on Wednesday night. Clarkson also shared that she had the surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles first thing on Thursday morning and is now “feeling awesome” as she recovers. “Not gonna lie…. I may or may not have broken down in tears after the show from pain  BUT thanks 2 all the amazing people @ Cedars-Sinai I flew home directly after the event, nailed the surgery early this morning, & feeling awesome now! Bye bye appendix  #TheShowMustGoOn ” she posted.
