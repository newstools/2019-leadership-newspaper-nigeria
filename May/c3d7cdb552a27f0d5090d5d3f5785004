The governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has urged Muslim Ummah to use the Holy Month of Ramadan and fasting to pray for the peace, security and development of the country. The party further enjoined all Nigerians to resist those he called divisive agents and their equally divisive messages and actions even as it  tasked Muslims to remember to cater for the less-privileged in their midst, stay humble and abstain from all bad deeds. This was containedin a goodwill message on Monday, signed by the APC National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, while calling on Muslim Ummah and all Nigerians of other faiths to continue to pray for the country and wisdom, good health and safety of leaders in a collective bid to take Nigeria to its deserved heights He said since Ramadan is a time of spiritual reflection, improvement, sacrifice and increased devotion and worship, Muslim Ummah should follow and apply the teachings of Islam in their relationship with neighbours, including Muslims and non-Muslims. He said, “It is our inalienable right as humans to safely go about our daily activities and to live in peaceful coexistence with our neighbours. Hence, in our places of worship, educational institutions, socio-political gatherings, markets, social media and all other public spaces, we must resist divisive agents and their equally divisive messages and actions.” “We must report to relevant authority’s agents of destruction who disguise as ethnic or religious champions to achieve their diabolic, selfish and heinous agenda by exploiting our perceived differences.” “The cases of kidnappings, banditry, ethno-religious and resource-fueled crises and other violent crimes recorded in some parts of the country are undoubtedly serious sources of concern. While the President Muhammadu Buhari administration is adopting multifaceted approach to permanently tackle the conflicts and crimes, the president has equally given marching orders to relevant security services to deal with these security threats and bring back normalcy to the affected areas.”
