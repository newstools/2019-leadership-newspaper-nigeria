Community leaders have decried incessant ritual killings in Arigidi Akoko in Ondo State, saying the people have resorted to divine intervention. It was gathered that the Zaki of Arigidi, Oba Yisa Olanipekun and the Oba-in-Council and the entire community have embarked on interdenominational prayers, traditional efforts coupled with local vigilante efforts to unravel the scourge of ritual killings. This, it was further gathered was strange to Arigidi Akoko which was one of the very peaceful communities in the area. It would be recalled two women were allegedly killed for ritual killings at Arigidi Akoko with their two breasts removed clinically. The Zaki of Arigidi, Oba Yisa Olanipekun at a meeting with the women who were the recent victims of the gruesome killing, disclosed that a son of Arigidi Akoko from Ogo Quarters, Mr. Tunde Ajileye alias Efo, 30-year-old had been arrested. He said his father handed him over to the traditional ruler who handed him over to the police. While noting that he had been taken to police headquarters Akure for further interrogation, he added that three suspects were now at state Criminal Investigation Department CID, Akure for their alleged roles in ritual killings at Arigidi. A woman leader, Mrs. Ayoka Oshodi on behalf of women, blamed youths looking for hot money, appealing to parents to be vigilant on their children living above their income. Meanwhile, the chairman, Akoko North West Local Government Area, Elder Samson Akande said his administration would give priority to security and generation of revenue. He said he was not happy with the recent killing of two women at Arigidi Akoko, and called on his management team to liaise with traditional rulers to make sure lives and property were safe in the area. He commended Governor Rotimi Akeredolu for his leadership style which made infrastructure possible in the nook and crannies of Ondo State
