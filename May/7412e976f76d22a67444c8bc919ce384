Ogun state governor-elect, Prince Dapo Abiodun has declared that he will revoke all new contracts awarded by the Ibikunle Amosun led outgoing administration between March and May 28th this year.  Abiodun also vowed to reverse all appointments and installation of traditional rulers as well as reviw of employments of new entrants into the state’s workforce done by Amosun’s administration after the March 9 governorship election which gave the victory.  This was contained in a statement issued yesterday in Abeokuta, the state capital, by the Publicity Secretary of the Caretaker Committed of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Ambassador ‘Tunde Oladunjoye  Speaking against the background of the rumours that Amosun was planning to approach the World Bank for a US $350 Million in less than three weeks to the expiration of his administration, Ogun APC said it had earlier warned financial institutions across the country against honouring any loans, overdrafts and other financial instruments’ request from the outgoing government of Ibikunle Amosun.  Side from this, the outgoing Amosun led administration has also approved the employment of about 500 fresh workers into the state’s workforce from among those who sat and passed the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON) examination.  But Oladunjoye in the statement issued yesterday however, accussed Amosun of making “last-minute appointments and awarded contracts without due consideration to the incoming administration of Prince Dapo Abiodun notwithstanding APC’s earlier warning”.  He noted that it was “morally unacceptable that a Governor with less than one month to the expiration of his term in office will make mass appointments and promotions, thereby committing the incoming administration to unsustainable financial commitments and obligations”.  “We hereby alert the general public and those to whom it may concern that ALL appointments, installation of traditional rulers, contracts, commitments and obligations entered into during the transition period after the elections will be reviewed and may not be binding on the new administration”.
