The minner of the maiden National Old Testament Competition in Nigeria, Mrs. Nkechinyere Chidi-Mbah has appealed to the Federal Government to invest more in the promotion of moral education. Chidi-Mbah, 38, who hails from Abia, said a partnership between Nigeria and Israel in the organization of the next edition of the competition will encourage young people to adopt the culture of studying the scriptures and acquiring knowledge. On the 14th of November 2018, 12 contestants from across Nigeria, competed for the title of the winner of the 1st National Old Testament Bible Contest in Nigeria. The audience was drawn from all 36 states including the FCT.  After a series of questions and eliminations, the only female finalist out of 12 emerged as the winner, to the delight of the wife of the Vice President, Mrs. Dolapo Osinbajo, who attended the finale. “Government should invest more in moral education of young people through such competitions to enable people gain the requisite knowledge to become self-reliant through information,” Chidi-Mbah said. The theme for the 2018 edition was: “Living peacefully in the promised land “and over 1800 persons participated in the three leveled competition which took place across the 36 states of Nigeria. The competition was part of the activities to mark the 70th anniversary celebration of Israel’s independence and 60 years since the first Bible contest was held in Israel. The theme for 2019 is “Unveiling the treasures in the land” and the registration was kicked off with a flag off event at the National Christian Centre in Abuja.
