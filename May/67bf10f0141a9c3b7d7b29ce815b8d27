A historian and former lecturer, Dr. Umar Ardo, has called on the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar and Muslims to resist the creation of four new caliphates by the Governor of Kano state Abdullahi Ganduje. It would be recalled that Ganduje on Saturday allegedly installed the four new Emirs of Rano, Bichi, Karaye and Gaya Emirates, who were appointed via a controversial bill he signed into law on Wednesday, saying that court order restraining the state government from implementing the law came late after letters of appointment had been issued to the new Emirs. Ardo during an interview with newsmen said, “The Sultan, all members of the caliphate, the Muslim ummah and the Fulbe people should not only condemn it but should stand up against it. He said the move would destroy the caliphate and accused the royal house of aiding and abetting the governor. “The emirates have already been created from the time of Shehu Uthman dan Fodio. And if you now start balkanizing them, you are just reducing the prestige and effectiveness of the emirate system”. It is the caliphate establishment that is the loser,” he said. The historian said the governor was exploiting divisions in the royal house between Muhammad Sanusi II, the Emir of Kano, and his cousins to undermine the emirate and its heritage. Ardo said, “Some of the members of the already established caliphate establishment are instigators of the problem because they are not on good terms with their cousins who are on the throne”. “They are forgetting that they are destroying the system of which they hope to one day benefit from. They are in fact benefitting from it because you do not have to be an emir to benefit from the emirate establishment.” He said though this was not the first time the caliphate would come under attack that silence would embolden the bulkanisers.
