There was a mild drama, yesterday, during the senate hearing  when an official of FAAN from Aminu Kano international airport disclosed that the scanners they have can’t detect drugs and other narcotics. The official was about giving further details when the committee chairman, Senator Kabiru Gaya hurriedly asked journalists to go out of the hall  and wait  to be brief later. Gaya said the committee was investigating the circumstances that led to the arrest of Miss Zainab Habibu Aliyu alongside others by the authorities of Saudi Arabia over drug related crimes aboard Egyptian Airlines in December,  2018. But chairman of the Nigeria Diaspora Commission (NDC),    Abike Dabiri-Erewa, alleged that two foreign Airlines, Egypt and Ethiopian Airlines are running drug cartels at Nigeria’s International Airports across the country. She who appeared before the Ad-hoc Committee panel headed by Senator Kabiru Gaya, said “We have other foreign and local Airlines operating at our Airports, but Egyptian and Ethiopian Airlines have drug cartels operating at our International Airports. “ “They operate alongside local collaborators.   It is not Air Peace, not Arik Air, but Egyptian and Ethiopian Airlines,  Dabiri insisted.
