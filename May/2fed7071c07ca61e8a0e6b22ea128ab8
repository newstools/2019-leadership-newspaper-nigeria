The acting project coordinator, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Fadama III Additional Financing Project, Rotimi Ajayi, has disclosed that the project has so far contributed immensely to the domestic production of rice in the nationâ€™s capital through trainings and funding support of rice farmers in the area of seed multiplication, adoption of proven rice production technology and other agronomic practices among others. Ajayi, who made the disclosure during the Farmers Green Field-day on dry season rice production organised by Noma Tushin Arziki Production Group Yaba, Abaji, said the project supports cluster of farmers in communities across FCT that have comparative advantage and high potential to increase production and productivity of Cassava, Rice and Sorghum value chain. While noting that the Presidential initiative on decreasing rice importation and increase domestic production is a decisive step which calls for proactive measures from all stakeholders in the rice development industry, he said the project was all about helping farmers to improve themselves and achieve the objectives of making food available to Nigerians. According to him, the transfer of technologies and their adoption have resulted to the production of over 84 metric tonnes of Faro-44 Rice Seed by 20 members of Fogbe Rice production cluster, Kwali Area Council at an average of 4.2MT per hectare as against the initial 0.8MT/Ha in 2017/2018 dry season farming. He advised farmers to continue to leverage on the project so as to achieve the targeted food sufficiency in the country. Also speaking, director, Admin and Finance, Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat, Federal Capital Territory Administration (ARDS-FCTA), Ayo Femi Folarin said the adoption of these simple technologies and proven agronomic practices by the farmers will no doubt boost the production and increase income of rice farmers in FCT, thereby enhancing food security. Folarin, while noting that the investment is aimed at increasing incomes of farmers on sustainable basis, said the FCT Administration under the leadership of Mallam Muhammed Musa Bello, has been very supportive to FCT Fadama III Additional Financing project through ARDS.
