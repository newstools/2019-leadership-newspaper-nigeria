At least 11 bandits and villagers were killed and many escaped with injuries on Thursday and Friday night during raids on five communities in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State by suspected bandits. Sources said late Thursday, no fewer than 30 bandits on motorcycles struck at Pauwa village leaving four persons with various degrees of injuries before they beat a retreat. The suspected gunmen or another band of hoodlums on a convoy of motorcycles launched major attacks in Kankara Local Government Area within 24 hours, which reportedly claimed three persons at Kanawan Dagidi, two in Dinya village, one in Ciroma village and two others in Kelawa village. Investigations further revealed that the suspected hoodlums also rustled most livestock in the predominantly Fulani villages during the attacks but they (the bandits) however, lost three of their men in a gun battle with some of the villagers. It was also learnt that bandits struck at Batsari Local Government Area at Garin Inu, after Rumah, along Batsari-Jibiya road and ransacked the village during a two-hour operation, which began around 11.30pm on Friday, May 17th, 2019. LEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that two of the critically ill victims of the attack on Pauwa village in Kankara Local Government Area were receiving treatment at Federal Medical Centre, Katsina while two others were on admission at General Hospital, Kankara. An eyewitness, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noted that many residents of the village were fleeing in their numbers after the operation, which lasted almost an hour. The public relations officer of the state police command, Isah Gambo, a Superintendent of Police (SP), claimed they were unaware of the incidents but however, confirmed that a combined air operation and ground troopsâ€™ attack on the hideouts of the suspected bandits in the areas before this weekend, no doubt, neutralised some of the bandits.
