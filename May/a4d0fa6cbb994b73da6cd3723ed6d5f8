The federal government has lamented that insecurity on the nation’s maritime domain has deteriorated assuring that it is determined to stamp out all forms of insecurity such as piracy, sea robbery, kidnapping for ransom and oil theft, among others within the nation’s maritime domain. The government said by January 2020, insecurity and maritime crime would be a thing of the past as it would begin a phased implementation of its new maritime security architecture. Recall that the Federal Executive Council FEC had last year approved a $195 million maritime security contract with an Israeli firm, HLS International Limited. The contract was in line with efforts to curb increasing criminal activities such as piracy, sea robbery, kidnapping, oil theft, illegal bunkering, smuggling and illegal trafficking in drugs and persons within the Gulf of Guinea, especially Nigeria. The immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, who addressed some stakeholders in Lagos in what appeared a valedictory session recently, admitted that the state of insecurity in the nation’s maritime industry has worsened in the last few months but assured that it will be a thing of the past between now and January 2020. According to him, the government is acquiring some maritime security assets comprising two helicopters, three vessels, which look like warships but are not, 19 fast speed interceptors, which have the capacity and capability of going into the creeks, given their shallow nature and some other assets that would boost the new anti-crime operations on the nation’s waters. He noted that some of the listed assets have already arrived the country and would be deployed in June, 2019 while some others are being expected after their construction, since the assets are not equipment that can be purchased off the shelf rather orders are placed according to specifications and delivered on agreed time schedule.
