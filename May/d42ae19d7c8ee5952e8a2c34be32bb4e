Commenting on the development in Lagos, the Dean, School of Media and Communication, PAU, Dr. Ikechukwu Obiaya said that the course will cover four key knowledge areas including Scripting and Directing for the Screen, Cinematography, Editing for the Screen and Sound Design for the Screen. He said while the course offers specialisation options in seven major film production areas of short films, documentaries, interviews, feature films, amongst others, it will work to animate the intersection of theory and practice in the philosophical, entrepreneurial, technological and aesthetic dimensions of cinema.
