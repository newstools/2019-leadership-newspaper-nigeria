The Maize Association of Nigeria (MAAN), has disclosed that government’s intervention in the agricultural sector has increased their yields from eight million MT in 2015 to 20 million MT in 2018, hence the importation of Maize  will not be needed. The national president of MAAN, Bello Abubakar, who made this known in an interview with journalists in Abuja , said their members who have grown from 1.2 million to over 5 million farmers have increased  their yield  over the years and can satisfy local demand. Abubakar while setting agenda for President Muhammadu Buhari in his second term, urged him to ensure that at the end of harvest, that the maize produced by the farmers is off-taken in order to sustain the Anchor Borrowers Program. On how prepared MAAN is for this year’s wet season farming, Abubakar said “we have done a lot, because we have already submitted a list of about 200 farmers to CBN for validation and verification. We have already held a lot of meetings with all the stakeholders in terms of input supply so that they will provide good and quality input products to our farmers. We have already made all the necessary arrangements, only waiting for the validated list of our farmers so that they can start supplying to our farmers. “We have already made all the necessary arrangements, only waiting for the validated list of our farmers so that they can start supplying to our farmers.  Also in terms of mechanisation and other extension services, we have done everything, only waiting for the verified list from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), so that we can just go ahead. In terms of the Fall Army Worm, last year, we collaborated with the FAO and the federal ministry of Agriculture in tackling it. “ We are going to use Aflasafe  in this farming season so that we now produce an aflatoxin free maize in Nigeria. As other organisations are claiming that our maize is always aflatoxin contaminated, but we are challenging that is not true.’’
