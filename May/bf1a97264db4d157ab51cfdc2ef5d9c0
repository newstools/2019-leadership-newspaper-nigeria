It was double tragedy in Ekan Ikare Akoko, Ondo State when a son killed his mother, Mrs Ajimo, simply identified as Mama Gbenga, before taking his life. The woman, who was based in Akure, was said to have been killed during a scuffle with her ‘notorious’ son called Ayotunde Gbenga Opeyemi. It was gathered that the victim had three children for her former husband at Ikare Akoko before moving to Akure to marry another man. It was one of the three children, Gbenga, who killed his mother at Akure and escaped to Ikare Akoko, where he stayed with his grandmother at Ekan quarters. When he suspected that efforts were on-going to hand him over to Ikare Police Division, he sneaked out in the night to the kitchen and took his life by hanging. Residents said the incident happened when everybody in the house had slept. A relation, who came out around 3am to ease herself, saw his body dangling and raised the alarm that attracted a large crowd. A police source in Akoko, which confirmed the incident, said investigation had commenced on the matter.
