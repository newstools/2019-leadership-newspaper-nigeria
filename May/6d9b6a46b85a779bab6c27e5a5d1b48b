A non-governmental organization, the Wisdom to Wealth and Development Foundation, has attributed the rising cases of cultism, drug abuse and violent crime among youths in the Niger Delta region to lack of mentorship and empowerment.  It said it has set up several programmes, aimed at nurturing the talents of youths in the region and empowering them in order to take their mind out of crime and criminality.  Addressing journalists at the Ernest Ikoli Press Centre, Port Harcourt yesterday, the Executive of the Foundation, Prince Anyanate Kio, said the intention of the organization is to build human capacity through positive mind engineering and vocational training with attitudinal change models designed to inspire performance.  Kio said: “As long as earth remains, rancor, strife, lack and crime always strive to better his lot by any means. Crime and other social vices are products of these adverse situations. And that is why we exist.  “Wisdom To Wealth and Development Foundation was founded with the intent of building human capacity through positive mind engineering and vocational training with attitudinal and practical change models designed to inspire performance.  “With attitudinal change and skills acquisition, we have improved the quality of life of Nigerians by teaching people to create wealth for personal use and improve society by utilizing the skills they have acquired.  “We believe that every skilled person becomes one more tax payer, one more respond citizen, one more potential employer of labour, one less mouth to feed, one less unemployed youth and one less potential swindler or criminal.”  Speaking also, prominent gospel musician, Asu Ekiye, appealed to state government and corporate organizations in the Niger Delta to partner with the Foundation to reach out to more youths in the region.
