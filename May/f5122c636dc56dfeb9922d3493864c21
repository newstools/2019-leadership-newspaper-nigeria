Kebbi State Commander of Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN), Lawal Muhammad Augie has said that in the wake of current security challenges facing Nigeria especially the armed banditry in the northern part of the country, members of Vigilante Group of Nigeria could play the role of State Police in order to compliment the efforts of Nigeria Police. Lawal made this statement in Birnin Kebbi while fielding questions from newsmen on the current agitation for the creation of state police. He said with proper training and weapons, the VGN can play the role of police in all the states of the federation. ”We can effectively carry out the role of state police if we are given proper training and weapons to combat crimes in the country, we can work hand in hand with other security agencies like the police, army and civil defense”, he said. According to the state VGN boss, the local security outfit has an existing structure from ward, local government and state level with at least 20 to 30 members in each ward. “I will suggest that the government strengthen the existing structure of VGN in order to ensure proper security. “Interestingly, most of our members come from their locality where they live and are retired soldiers, police and even SSS who have one form of training or the other “, he said. Lawal commended the Nigeria Police Command in Kebbi for collaborating with them especially in the fight against armed banditry and other forms of crimes such as kidnapping and cattle rustling. He called for more synergy between the police and VGN to combat crimes and appealed to all tiers of government, the well-to-do and members of the general public to assist the VGN to compliment the efforts of the police in ensuring security of lives and protection of property of our people.
