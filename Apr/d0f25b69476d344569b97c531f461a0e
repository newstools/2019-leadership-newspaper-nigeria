Comrade Kolawole Olumoh, the Chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC) in Kwara has urged government at all levels to curb any irrational increase in the prices of commodities. Olumoh stated this on Sunday in Ilorin while speaking with the Newsmen on the presidential assent to the new minimum wage bill. The TUC leader, who applauded President Muhammadu Buhari for giving Nigerian workers a new wage, noted however that the concern was that marketers and manufacturers would increase prices of their products irrationally. “We appreciate the President for the quick assent and a promise fulfilled. “However, it is of concern that marketers and manufacturers alike seize this as an opportunity to irrationally increase prices of their products “This will impact negatively on the increased value of our wages,’’ he said. Olumoh explained that for the purchasing power of a new minimum wage to be useful, impactful and effective, government at all levels must assist in protecting and enforcing measures that would curb irrational increase in prices of commodities. This, the trade union leader said would safeguard the workers, citizens and the economy as a whole. He also urged the president to order the release the state share of Paris Club refund to enable the payment of all outstanding arrears of salaries and pensions owed the state workers and retirees. “We want to appeal to the president to, as a matter of urgency, intervene in the non-release of Paris Club refund to Kwara State. “There is a serious need for this so as to enable the state to pay-off all outstanding arrears of salaries and pensions being owed as well as to offset indebtedness to state Parastatals and MDAs. “This is an appeal on behalf of starving Kwara workers and inhabitants as a whole,’’ the TUC boss said.
