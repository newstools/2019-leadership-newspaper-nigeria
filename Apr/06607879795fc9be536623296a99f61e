The Youth Wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (YOWCAN) has condemned smear campaign against the national president of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Olasupo Ayokunle after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. In a statement issued by its national secretary, Arc Abel Divine Ogwuche, the group called on Nigerians not to see the stand of its immediate past leader, Daniel Kadzai as the decision of the youths. The statement added that the purported meeting claimed to had been held at the National Secretariat of CAN  by Arewa Christians Indigenous Pastors Association(ACIPA) under the leadership of Rev. Luke Shehu; Coalition Of Christians Groups for Good Governance- Nigeria and Diaspora (COCGOG) led by Daniel Kadzai; Patriotic Christians Youth of Nigeria (PCYN) led by Evang. Timothy Nasso; Arise Christians Network led by Pastor Joseph Zephaniah and Christians Youth integrity Group by Godwin Yilpina were all propaganda and malicious aimed at denting the image of the CAN president. Explaining why the CAN president visited President Muhammadu Buhari, the statement said it was in relation to the victims of Boko-Haram insurgency in the North East. “It was part of the official itinerary of the CAN president in the year 2019, and it was to also discuss the donation of relief materials to the victims,” the youths said. “The official visit of the CAN leadership to President Buhari, no doubt, a medium to have one on one chat to address critical issues affecting the Christian Community in Nigeria most especially in the areas of security challenges, insurgency, ethnic violence, kidnapping, herdsmen’s atrocities prevalent in our nation and the release of Leah Sharibu amongst others,” the statement added.
