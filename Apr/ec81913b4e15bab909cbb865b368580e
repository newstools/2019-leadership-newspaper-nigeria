The Muslim Rights Concern MURIC has called on the leadership of the Northern Christian Elders Forum (NCEF) not politicise the conviction of former Chief Justices of Nigeria, Walter Onnoghen, by the Code of Conduct Tribunal due to his failure to properly declare his assets. Apparently reacting to NCEF’s statement that the conviction of former CJN was part of the jihad against Christians in the country, the director of MURIC, Prof. Ishaq Akintola in a statement yesterday, rejected the allegation, saying that what Nigeria needs is peaceful atmosphere. The group which affirmed that what Nigeria needs now is a peaceful environment, said that there could be no meaningful development without peace and stability. According to MURIC, Nigerians should stop heating the polity. It explained that Nigerian Muslims have no Islamisation agenda, saying “we are willing to peacefully coexist with both Christians and traditionalists as neighbours and on equal terms. “We are still wondering about what happened to NCEF. This is a group of elders who, ceteris paribus, should know better and, consequently, contribute positively to the national discuss. But we are perturbed by its pedestrian outbursts. “The most arbitrary claim of the group has to do with the removal of the suspended CJN. NCEF claimed the removal of Onnoghen is a continuation of stealth jihad which began with the coup against Gowon. It is as ludicrous as it is infantile. “Perhaps NCEF is also suggesting that the National Judicial Council (NJC) which found Onnoghen guilty of the charges levelled against him is engaging in jihad. When will NCEF stop seeing religion in every big or little thing? Why should the Onnoghen issue be turned into religious blackmail?’’
