Former chief security officer to the late head of state, Major Hamza Al-Mustapha (rtd) and some retired military officers may have begun to making some overtures to the insurgents in order to secure the release of the remaining Chibok school girls from the captivity of the Boko Haram insurgents. This follows a recent call by the umbrella body of some pro-Buhari groups, Buhari Integrity Support Group (BIG) and Standing Up for Integrity (SUFI) on the current administration to consider bringing on board Major Hamza Al-Mustapha (rtd) and other retired military officers in order to boost current fight against insurgency and insecurity in some parts of the country. LEADERSHIP recalls that Boko Haram fighters stormed the Government Secondary School Chibok in Borno state five years ago to abduct over 200 female students of the school, the insurgents also invaded another school in Dapchi, Yobe state, about two years ago, taking away Leah Shuaibu and over a hundred of her mates. It was learnt that Al-Mustapha had been working with to secure the release of the abducted girls. Some pro-Muhammadu Buhari groups had noted during their meeting in Abuja last Thursday that making the likes of Al-Mustapha and other retired and serving military officers part of the country’s security architecture in the next dispensation would enable the Buhari administration to come up with new ideas aimed at addressing the various security challenges and even assist the government in securing the release of Shuaibu and the remaining Chibok school girls from the hold of Boko Haram. The National Coordinator of the BIG, Sampson Anyebe, who spoke on behalf of the other members of the groups at a news conference in Abuja, had argued that Nigeria did not lack capable persons and experts who had what would be required to stop the country’s descent into anarchy and chaos. Anyebe had also noted that the country and the government only needed to give such capable Nigerians the opportunity to offer their services and expertise to the nation in the best way and capacity they could. The groups had further expressed confidence that Al-Mustapha and other retired military officers had the relevant experience and the capability to assist the country in effectively tackling the current insecurity and bringing the unfortunate development to an end. The groups had also claimed that Al-Mustapha was instrumental to the release of the Islamic clerics and prayer warriors, who were abducted recently, but released few days later without the payment of any ransom.
