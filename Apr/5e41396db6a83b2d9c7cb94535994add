The Eugenia Abu Media Centre has said that it will hold the first edition of her creative entrepreneurship programme, ‘The Creative Feast.’ The center, in a press release in Abuja yesterday, said the programme will feature Nollywood actor, Segun Arinze as Lead facilitator and faculty. “The one-day event is scheduled for the April 30, 2019, at The Eugenia Abu Media Centre, Maitama Amusement Park, Abuja.” “This initiative is to educate young creative entrepreneurs about the process of creative entrepreneurship, how to get in the game and stay in the game, how to source resources for projects and tools and requirements for remaining relevant in the field,” it said. The release added that Eugenia Abu will also be on hand to deal with the subject of creative entrepreneurship and legacy. “It is erroneously believed that to become a successful actor, photographer, chef and comedian requires little or no work. This initiative will feature successful celebrities who would give master – classes, one-on-ones, role play and field questions from participants.” The managing partner and CEO, The Eugenia Abu Media Centre (TEAM), Eugenia Abu, is concerned about how youths are falling for different scams of how they can be stars overnight and is offering this golden opportunity at the centre.
