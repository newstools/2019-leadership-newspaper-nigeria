An Abuja-based nongovernmental organisation, Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has donated food items, comprising mini bags of rice, corn, beans, millet, as well as groundnut oil and spices to 100 widows in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Presenting the items to the widows in Abuja at the weekend, the founder/president of the foundation, Dr. (Mrs.) Jumai Ahmadu, explained that the donation was meant to assist the women celebrate Easter, with their children. Ahmadu added that the women were picked through their respective group leaders, which are spread all over the FCT, adding that that foundation has about 1,500 widows under its care in various parts of the territory. “My philosophy in life, based on my background, is that nobody is too poor to give and nothing is too small to give. No matter how poor you are, there is somebody you are richer than. That is why since 2003, we have been bringing these women out in small number, to give them support, by the grace of God.” She said that foundation also assist these widows periodically by paying for their children school fees, including other forms of empowerment, such skills acquisition programmes. She revealed that the foundation has also introduced a non-profit evolving loan scheme to ensure that these women are empowered, so that they can buy these food items themselves, make some savings and also look after the children their husbands left behind.
