The security challenge in Nigeria is sponsored with both local and international linkages in terms of interest, former minister of Sports, Bala Ka’oje, has said. According to the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, President Muhammadu Buhari has done much in curtailing the security challenges in the country, adding that he needs more support to tackle the current spate of killings and not abuses. Ka’oje, who stated this, yesterday, while speaking to journalists in Abuja, said Nigeria couldn’t be exempted from the current unrest in the world adding that people of goodwill must come together to support the president to tackle the insecurity challenges. The former lawmaker cum administrator, said that Nigerians need to understand the kind of banditry and insurgency that is going on, adding, “The security challenge has both local and international linkages, in terms of interest and multifarious sponsorship styles. This guerilla type of war is very difficult to end or conquer as the perpetrators live and dine with you and suddenly disappear into thin air to strike at you. It is worse than America- Vietnamese war, may be comparable to the war in Afghanistan with the Taliban.  President Muhammadu Buhari is making lots of efforts using the military and the security agencies, and the war is being won gradually,”Ka’oje said. Nigeria has been battling with insurgents in the Northeast since 2007 and in 2015, banditry also surfaced in the Northwest where hundreds of people have been killed by alleged bandits. Zamfara State became the central point of the heinous attack by the banditry due to the mining activities in the state, while Kaduna State is faced with kidnapping crime all perpetrated by bandits.
