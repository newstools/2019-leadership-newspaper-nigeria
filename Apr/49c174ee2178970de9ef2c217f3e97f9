Amidst the hitch-free Easter celebration in Borno , Christians all over the state have been urged to emulate the selfless sacrifices made by Jesus Christ, by offering himself to be sacrificed for the redemption of human race. In most churches visited by our correspondent, the various clergies centred their messages on the need for the faithful to love one another and shun evil tendencies such as greed, corruption, killings and behaviours contrary to the teachings of Christ. At the St.Mary Catholic Church Maiduguri the officiating Priest, Rev.Fr. Peter Uchebo in his homily, noted that Christians all over the world are celebrating this day because one offered himself for sacrifice. Fr. Uchebo further urged Nigerians to use the window of celebration to show love to one another and end the unwanted killings in the country which he attributed to greed for power and riches. “We are today celebrating the triumph of light against darkness and evil.  Let us offer to one another selfless  love as done by Mary Magdalene and the women who had gone to anoint the body of Christ in the tomb only to discover that Christ has risen from death to life,’ he said. At the ECWA 1 Maiduguri, the ministering servant of God, Pastor Steven Beici called on Christians to pray for the return of total peace in Borno and northeast. Pastor Beici further urged members to resonate the teachings and life of Christ in their daily activities for a peaceful society.
