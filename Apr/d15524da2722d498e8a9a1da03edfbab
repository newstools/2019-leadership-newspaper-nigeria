Rev Fr Charles Ekeng of St Peters Catholic Parish, Mbiabong Anyanya, Uyo,  Akwa Ibom state has cautioned parishioners against wearing of indecent clothes to the church. Ekeng who gave the warning in his homily during Easter Sunday mass said the House of God is not a social gathering for showcasing the body and transparent wears but rather a place to reverence the Almighty with humility. He said that indecent dressing to the Church would no longer be tolerated in the parish. The priest said that the parish’s authority has instructed its personnel at the gate on what to do in case anyone coming to the church dressed indecently to Church programmes. “Indecent dressing to the Church will not be tolerated. Be it male or female you should dress well to the church. “There should be no miniskirts and any other kind of exposing clothes to the church. “I will not want to embarrass anybody but If you are found wanting, you will be asked to go back home to dress properly. So let’s avoid embarrassment, please.” The Priest also called for unity among parishioners to enhance spiritual and physical growth of the parish. “As Christians, we should know the kind of dress to wear while coming into the house of the Lord to pray, we should therefore refrain from wearing skimpy clothes to distract others because the Church is a place of worship, not a night club”. The Rev Father noted that, he cannot fathom why people with right state of mind should dress indecently to Church because “it is uncalled for”. Ekeng also urged worshipers to imbibe the culture of dressing decently not just to the Church but other social gatherings because “you are addressed as you are dressed”. “Our body is the temple of God as it is written in the Bible, therefore, we should honour it, by covering up well,” he said.
