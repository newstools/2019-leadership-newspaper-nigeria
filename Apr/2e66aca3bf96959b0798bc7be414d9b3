Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has dismissed as “total fabrication” reports that he spent $30,000 to hire a US lobby group to persuade the US Congress to stop the inauguration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The former vice president in a statement signed by his media aide, Paul Ibe, said the allegation was instigated by the Buhari Campaign Organisation, describing it as shameless lies. The statement added that the report which is the latest dirty propaganda against the former vice president “didn’t come as a surprise to us because lying has so far become their only bragging rights of competence.” The statement further said that “lying has become a culture to the APC administration and therefore, we are not surprised by their latest diversionary allegations’’. “Since Atiku resisted pressure not to go to court, the APC has been behaving like a cat on hot bricks because the outcome of the 2019 elections has exposed and shattered the facade of their dubious integrity.” According to Ibe, “the APC are behaving nervously like a thief living under the fear of being exposed and shamed”, and that “they are now using fake news against Atiku instead of focusing on defending themselves in the court.” “For a party that has broken the worst record in election rigging, the APC doesn’t have any iota of integrity to be taken seriously by anybody”, the statement adds. According to Ibe, “Atiku’s court case has become their biggest burden because it exposes their integrity as a sham, and instead of defending their stolen mandate in court, they are now using fake news to divert public attention from the historic electoral heist they have committed against Nigerians.” The statement added that no amount of diversionary propaganda and fake news campaign by APC will stop Atiku Abubakar from continuing the court action he started to reclaim the ‘stolen’ mandate.
