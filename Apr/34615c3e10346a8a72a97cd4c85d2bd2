As the race for who becomes the Speaker of the 9th House of Representatives hots up, youths under the auspices of Middle Belt Youth Movement For Unity, Equity, Fairness And Justice, have advised the leadership governing All Progressives Congress (APC) to take a second look at the zoning formula for leadership positions in the country so as to give all zones a sense of belonging. The movement added that if this is not done, what happened in 2015 may repeat itself as disenchanted members may be willing to form alliance that may eventually be against the next level agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari. This was the submission made by the youths after a retreat in Abuja, even as they announced their endorsement of Hon Nnkiruka Onyejeocha, the current House committee chair person on Aviation, charging both new and returning members to support her candidacy for the Speakership. Addressing the media, spokesperson of the group, Aaron Mike Odeh, insisted that this would enhance the spirit of inclusiveness especially considering the fact that she is from the Southeast. “As we come to the end of our two day strategic meeting with the major aim of brainstorming on how the members of middle belt in Nigeria and beyond can develop in all areas and Nigeria as a whole, we also wish to use this opportunity to call on the President as the leader of every Nigerian and the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), to ensure the equitable distribution of all the sensitive national positions to give all the six geopolitical zones a sense of belonging. “For this reason, we wish to appeal to him and all the political leaders in Nigeria to support the call for the zoning of the Speakership position of the 9th Assembly to Southeast, since they are also one among the major ethnic groups in Nigeria. Sincerely, the contribution of the southeastern Nigeria towards the independence of Nigeria, the growth of the country’s economy and otherwise, cannot be overemphasise. “Presently the Southeast has a very high ranking member that is currently doing her third term. And as God would have it, she won re-election. I am talking about Nnkiruka Onyejeocha, the current House committee chairperson on Aviation. “Nnkiruka has all it takes to pilot the affairs of the 9th Assembly.” He said.
