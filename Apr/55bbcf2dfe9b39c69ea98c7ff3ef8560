As Christian faithful in Nigeria join others to mark the spiritual feast of Easter, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, said three thousand of their corps have been deployed to maintain peace and order.  This is just called on residents of the state to embrace peaceful co-existence and shun divisive tendencies.  Assistant Commandant General, Modu Bunu, who made the call while felicitating with residents, said the state has witnessed different security challenges recently, hence his call.  He urged residents to eschew violence and issues with potentials of causing disharmony along ethnic and religious ties, advocating peace and unity which are necessary for development.  Bunu charged parents and guardians to ensure proper upbringing of children and wards, noting that anyone caught indulging in any criminal act will face the wrath of the law.  According to him, the action has become possible as part of strategies in responding to some challenges leading to hardship.  The ACG explained that in order to respond to distress situations, the command has concluded plans to deploy adequate personnel numbering over 3,000 to ensure hitch-free Easter celebrations.  The deployment will take care of worship centres, markets, recreational facilities, suspected black spots and routine patrols, he said..  “The command will throw its search light on suspected black spots and arrest with view to punishing those perpetrators of illegal acts”.  The ACG congratulated Christians on the successful completion of lent and celebration of Easter which marks the death of Jesus Christ for salvation of mankind.  He urged Christians to emulate the good virtues of Christ which includes peace and forgiveness.
