The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has  arrested over 50 people who write the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) for candidates. In its Weekend Bulletin, the Board disclosed that it has uncovered professional examination writers noting that master’s degree holders, post graduate and undergraduate students ‘were among the professional examination writers caught in the act’. According to JAMB, the professional examination writers connive with owners of Computer Base Test (CBT) centres to perpetrate the crime adding that they organise multiple registrations where their print and the candidates they are taking the exam for are taken side by side. JAMB revealed that one of the fraudsters who was apprehended confirmed that he organises multiple registration of his biometrics alongside several candidates preparing to take the 2019 examination with the intention of taking the exams on their behalf in exchange for money. It added that JAMB has in this 2019 examination, insisted on revalidation of all biometrics of candidates so as to apprehend people planning on engaging in examination malpractices. LEADERSHIP recalls that JAMB has insisted that only candidates who were verified by biometrics will be allowed to take the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) that started on April 11, 2019. It stated that any candidate that cannot be verified by the Biometric Verification Mode must not be allowed to take the examination under any guise.
