Senior production manager of the Eastern Metal, Asaba, Ranjan Mishra has pointed out that epileptic power supply is one of the greatest problems militating against the development of the metallurgical industry in Nigeria. Mishra who stated this while speaking to newsmen on the sideline of the 2-day Metallurgical Industry Stakeholders Forum held on the 16th and 17th April, 2018 in Asaba, the Delta State Capital said his Asaba based company which produces construction metals faces a lot of challenges, especially in the areas of electricity, transport and raw materials which have made breakthrough very difficult. He said his company lost about N20 million to poor electricity supply in the month of March, 2018. Mishra who advised that the industrial policies of the country be reviewed and made to look up said,  “Right now I don’t think business in Nigeria, especially the metal industry is doing well. We are suffering various problems, especially in the area of electricity, transport, raw materials, etc. “If any country is to grow, it has to fix all these problems, especially electricity which is needed 24 hours nonstop. “Electricity I must say is a serious problem here, and there is no way you can have a functional economy without stable electricity supply. We lost about N20 million to power outage only last month,” he said. On the paucity of raw materials, the Senior Manager who has been in the country for just six months said he read that there is plenty of natural resources all over the land, but which has not been harnessed by the locals for industrial development, urging the authorities to focus on maximising the benefit of the resources locally. “We need to focus on our resources. A situation where foreigners come in and take them away only to returned them as finished products will not in any way help the country,” he noted.
