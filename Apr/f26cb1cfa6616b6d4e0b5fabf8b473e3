Re-elected Etsako federal house of representatives member,  Johnson Oghuma, yesterday disclosed that the incoming 9th National Assembly would ensure that it fosters a harmonious relationship with the executive arm to fast track good governance for Nigerians. The parliamentarian regretted that the outgoing 8th assembly, although dominated by the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, acted as obstacle to the executive arm of government, thereby frustrating the developmental plans of President Muhammadu Buhari. He also said the horse-trading for leadership at the national assembly is expected as every lawmaker is free to contest for any leadership positions adding that the APC as the dominant party in both houses would smoothly produce the leadership due to its numerical advantage. Oghuma, spoke in Auchi, Etsako West local government area of Edo State shortly after distribution of empowerment items worth millions of Naira, to members of his constituent. He said: “Nigerians should expect things to be different this time around. You know it is not too long that I went to the house. I went to the national assembly in February 17th 2017, I discovered that members of my party both at the senate and the House of Representatives were problems to the APC led government at the centre. “The 9th assembly will collaborate with the executives, our role is complimentary, no one is an island, we are supposed to work together to produce the desired results that Nigerians are yearning for, our people are suffering, Buhari meant so well for our people, he is not stealing our money, he believes that the people should have what they are entitled to and that’s why we will support him and the Judiciary to succeed” The lawmaker also disclosed that some beneficiaries of the empowerment items have been trained and would be supported with cash grant to kick start their trade. He listed some aspect of trade some beneficiaries have received training to include, Fishery, Tailoring, Welding, Solar Power Repairs and Installation, Cosmetology, CCTV installation and  Repairs, as well as Aluminum Fabrication.
