The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has initiated a process to establish an Internet Industry Code of practice in order to sanitise the operation of Internet service provider and internet industry as a whole. Speaking at the 48th Edition of the Consumers Town Hall meeting in Ile-ife, Osun State, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta said the Internet Code would be a regulatory intervention that will help to secure the society’s Cyber space against imminent threats from Cyber attackers. According to him, the measure would also address issues such as online Child protections, privacy and data protection among others. Danbatta who spoke on the theme, “Mitigating Effects of Cybercrimes: The roles of Telecom Consumers” expressed the preparedness of the Commission to always sensitize Telecoms Consumers on the rising wave of Cybercrime in its various forms. He also remarked that the Liberalization of the Telecoms Industries has led to an unprecedented increase in the usage and dependence on Internet -base solutions and services. Danbatta also made it clear that the commission will educate consumers on various on- going Consumers -centered initiatives and programmes being carried out by the Commission. He noted that the Consumers Town Hall meeting was one of the fora initiated by the Commission to bring together telecoms consumers in the rural and semi-urban areas with the service providers as well as the Regulators for a direct face-to-face interaction on telecoms issues affecting the Consumers.
