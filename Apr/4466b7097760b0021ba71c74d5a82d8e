A 45 -year-old driver, Simon Ogbu, was on Friday docked before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly stealing a car valued at N1.6 million. Ogbu, a resident of Oworosoki, Lagos, is facing two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The Police Prosecutor, ASP Clifford Ogu, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Jan. 28, at Oniru Estate, Lagos. He said that the defendant and one other person, still at large, stole the Hyundai jeep belonging to Coscharis Mobility Ltd. Ogu said that the complainant entered into a filling station to buy fuel, and in the process the defendant attacked him and stole the car. According to Ogu, after the complainant filled the tank, the defendant snatched the car and drove off. “The vehicle was tracked, recovered and the defendant was arrested,’’ the prosecutor said. The offences contravened Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes a three-year jail term for stealing, while Section 411 attracts two years for conspiracy. Following his plea of not guilty, Magistrate J.A. Adegun released him on bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Adegun said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payments to the Lagos State Government (LASG). The case was adjourned until May 8, for further hearing.
