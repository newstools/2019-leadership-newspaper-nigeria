In his contribution, the special adviser to Kebbi State Governor on power, political and chieftaincy affairs, Alhaji Yusuf Haruna Rasheed (Sardaunan Gwandu) called on all stakeholders “to disabuse the minds of their subjects, supporters and members of erroneous impression that electricity is free”.
