Following the gruesome murder of an 80-year-old woman, Mrs Kojusola Mogaji, by suspected ritualists, fear, anxiety and panic, have gripped the people and residents of Arigidi Akoko in Ondo State. The deceased, a resident of Imo Quarters, Arigidi Akoko, Northwest local government area of the state, was killed by yet to be identified ritualists. This recent killing on Thursday night is the sixth to be recorded in recent times and in all cases, the breasts of the victims were removed clinically. Two of the incidences occurred opposite Ecobank Ikare, and another at Agbaluku Arigidi. It was observed that since the recent killing in the area, the people have become anxious and fearful especially women, who are afraid of even going for regular Church and Mosque programmes in the early hours of the morning. Apart from that, it was also observed that the people were no longer willing to open their doors to just anybody for fear of being greeted by attackers. The brother of the latest victim, Mr Vincent Sunday, has, since his sister’s death, urged traditional rulers and community leaders in the area to speak up about the unpleasant situation even as he called for a security summit in Akokoland. He urged security agents to beam their searchlight on Akokoland since residents no longer felt safe. The daughter of the deceased, Mrs Kehinde Adewumi, who is a local government official, appealed to the police to investigate and bring to book, those responsible for her mother’s sudden death.
