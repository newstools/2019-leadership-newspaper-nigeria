The Zamfara State Government has commended the Federal Government for banning mining activities in the state to help in tackling insecurity facing the state. Governor Abdul’aziz Yari gave the commendation on Sunday in Talata-Mafara after a meeting with security chiefs in the state. Yari said that the state government welcomed the policy by the Federal Government, describing it as good for the people of the state. “Zamfara as host of these miners have not been benefiting from them and mining activities must be suspected  because most of them are doing activities close to bandits’ camps and nothing is affecting them. “Therefore miners must be suspected because of these reasons. So we welcome this decision and we are going to support it, ‘’ he said. Yari appealed to communities in the state to cooperate with security agencies. According to him, the state government is doing its best to ensure their success. He commended the Federal Government for deploying security agencies to the state and “we hope it will end banditry in this state’’. “We have started seeing positive results due to measures put in place and we hope these will be sustained,’’ the governor said.
