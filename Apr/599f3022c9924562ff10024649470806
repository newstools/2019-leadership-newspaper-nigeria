The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) yesterday said it has no figure of applicants who have so far applied for the ongoing recruitment of the service. The NCS had opened its portal on Wednesday, April 17, for the recruitment of 3,200 officers and men to the Service of which 800 Nigerians would be recruited as support staff for superintendent cadre category, while the balance of 2,400 would be employed under customs inspector and customs assistant cadre in the general duty categories. But, speaking to LEADERSHIP yesterday, the national public relations officer of the Service, Joseph Attah, said the Service has no actual number of Nigerians that so far applied for the recruitment. According to him, the number grows every minute and the Service was more concerned about responding to operational challenges faced by the applicants. He said, “I don’t have answer to that, we are not in the business of counting because the number is increasing by the minute but our concern is to respond to operational questions if there are challenges, if some people are talking about filling the form and the system is discriminating against certain institutions, we correct it and if people are observing operational challenges we attend to it. “But, once we are done, we announce the total number of Nigerians that have applied and the shortlisted candidates will be announced and published so that is the situation.” When asked whether the Service has any intention to extend the closing date of the recruitment exercise, Attah said there was no intention.
