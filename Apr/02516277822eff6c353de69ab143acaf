Nigerian Breweries (NB) Plc has announced a revenue of N83.278 billion for the first quarter of 2019 in its unaudited and provisional results released to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the period ended March 31, 2019. The results showed that the N83.278 billion revenue represents a 0.4 per cent increase over the N82.966 billion declared in the corresponding period in 2018. The company made a profit after tax of N8.026 billion during the period, lower than the N10.204 billion recorded in the same period in 2018, signifying a 21.4 per cent decline. In the statement signed by the company secretary/legal director, Uaboi Agbebaku said the increase in net revenue was offset by higher excise duty following the excise duty regime introduced in 2018. Cost of sales increased by 7.3 per cent primarily driven by raw materials and consumables, while marketing and distribution expenses increased 7.9 per cent over the same period in 2018. Administrative expenses reduced by 12 percent, partially driven by the right sizing exercise undertaken by the company in third quarter (Q3), 2018. Also, the company’s total assets stood at N388.81 billion slightly lower than N388.586 billion recorded in 2018, while total shareholders’ equity went up by 0.11 per cent to N174.92 billion from N174.73 billion in 2018. The company stated that the impact of inflation and currency devaluation was minimised by the continued focus on cost efficiencies delivered through Cost Leadership initiatives.
