While a lot of efforts have saved seven million lives from malaria and prevented more than one billion cases, community empowerment is critcal to achieve a malaria-free world, says the African Media and Malaria Research Network (AMMREN). The executive secretary, AMMREN, Dr. Charity Binka, while acknowledging the efforts being made to raise funds for the malaria elimination agenda, noted that there is an urgent need for education to get people to take personal responsibility for malaria prevention and treatment. Themed: ‘Zero Malaria Starts With Me’ Binka said the 2019 world malaria day reminds citizens everywhere that they not only have personal responsibility in protecting their families, communities and countries from this preventable disease, but also have the power to hold their leaders accountable for meeting their commitments to end the disease. She said the ‘Zero Malaria Starts With Me’ campaign engage all members of the society, adding that political leaders who control government, make policy decisions and budgets is critcal to success. “Private sector companies that will benefit from a malaria-free workforce; healthcare providers working towards controlling and eliminating malaria and most importantly communities affected by malaria, whose by-in and ownership of malaria control interventions are also critical to success,” she added. She said so far, five African countries namely Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda, Niger and Zambia have joined the zero malaria movement, while Ghana and a few others are expected to join this pivotal global movement soon. She however urged countries like Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda that are labeled as the malaria highest burden countries to step up efforts to tackle the disease.
