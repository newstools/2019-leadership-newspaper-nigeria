As President Muhamadu Buhari takes oath of office for a second term next month, the Executive Director of Pecmee Omotola International limited, Engineer David Opatola has condemned recommendation for sales of public assets to economic predators, saying it will compound sufferings of Nigerians. Opatola who stated this while speaking with Newsmen in Lagos urged the president not hesitate to formulate policies that would quicken the struggle to banish poverty and stabilize the political economy of the country. He urged the federal government to hasten arrangements for the establishment of modular refineries in at least ten (10) locations in Nigeria in addition to existing ones. Opatola who is one of the few Nigerian sponsored by the Commonwealth in machine design and manufacturing said he had submitted a document to President, Muhammadu Buhari tagged “ Springboard Economic Development Towards Industrial master Plan for Nigeria Active and Meaningful Industrialization ” to set agenda for the government. While frowning at the habits of selling the country’s sensitive assets to people and or organizations whose knowledge in such field is unknown and to those who lack the capacity to run such, Engineer David Opatola suggested that every state assets should henceforth be made public through the stock exchange. He explained that,’’ The entrenched trend of allowing individuals whose financial background cannot be known to buy our assets has done a lot of damages to the economy of the country and has denied her the chances and opportunity to generate employment and create wealth for the country. ‘’Nigeria with a population of about 200 million and still dependent on oil which today remains fragile in the international market, there is an urgent need for the president to put in place structures that can springboard the country’s economic development towards industrial master plan so as to make the citizens enjoy good life, get employed, banish poverty and grow the country’s GDP.
