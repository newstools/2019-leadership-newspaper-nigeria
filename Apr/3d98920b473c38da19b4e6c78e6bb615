Worried by the difficulties noticed in the transportation of patients through and fro the hospitals in Yobe and Adamawa, the Presidential Committee on Northeast Initiative, PCNI has donated two ambulances to the Sexual Assault Referral Centers (SARCs). Speaking on the reason for the donations, the vice chairman of the PCNI, Tijani Tumsa said the donations were based on the request of the Steering Committee on Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Adamawa and Yobe states. According to him, the centers, which are meant to cater for victims of sexual gender based violence, psycho-social trauma cases and other conditions such as sexually transmitted diseases, VVF, HIV/AIDS and others, always experience difficulty transporting its patients. Presenting the buses to the representatives of the two states in Abuja, Tumsa said the centres, which were established by the PCNI in collaboration with the British Council of Nigeria through the Managing Conflict in Northeast Programme (MCN), were lacking ambulances to convey victims to the hospital. According to him, “A gap however, was identified in both Centers by the state ministries of Health which is the absence of an ambulance to convey victims from their lotions to the center for treatment and counseling. “Therefore, based on the requst of the Steering Committee on Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Adamawa and Yobe states, PCNI is pleased to provide an ambulance vehicle each to both SAR Centers in Adamawa and Yobe States.” He further assured that President Muhammadu Buhari was committed to ensuring that victims of insurgency were properly taken care of and ensuring that insurgency tackled completely.
