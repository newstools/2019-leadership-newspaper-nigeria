Outlook for the week In the new week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expected the Nigerian equities market to close in positive territory as more companies release their first quarter (Q1) 2019 financial results, which are expected to be fairly positive. Hence, we feel investors would take advantage of the low share prices to raise the local bourse upwards.
