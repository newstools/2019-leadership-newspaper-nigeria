The director general of Nigeria First Project, Famous Housing Advocate and co-founder of the Young Democratic Party (YDP), Arc. Nya Etuk Ezekiel has decried the rising cases of vote buying, saying that it can cause more harm than Boko Haram, bandits, herdsmen and kidnappers all put together. Our correspondent reports that Ezekiel ran for the governorship position of Akwa Ibom State in the recently concluded elections where he lost to the incumbent Governor Emmanuel Udom. Arch Etuk who spoke while briefing newsmen in Abuja yesterday described vote buying as the cancer that attacks the nation’s institutional framework, revealing that the recently concluded elections recorded political parties paying as high as N15,000 to voters to buy their votes. “Vote buying is going to do to this country more harm than insurgency, Boko Haram, killer herdsmen, kidnapping or even militancy all put together,” he said. According to him “The reason is whether militancy, killer herdsmen, Boko Haram or any form of insurgency can be addressed by a well set up institutional framework, but vote buying is the cancer that attacks directly our institutional framework on account that all other insurgencies can never be addressed when the system is compromised.” The Architect revealed that “I have decided with a few other likeminded people who were part of the last election and those not even part of the vote buying to take the issue of vote buying to the highest level, not just in this country but the International Criminal Court (ICC). “At that level vote buying is already seen as crime against humanity and we want to make it such that any President or head of state thatcan be directly or indirectly linked to the act, even if he is able to dodge the laws of the country, will not be able to dodge the ICC.” He called on elders and all well-meaning citizens to wake up to the evil, realities and implications of vote buying and its implications for Nigeria noting that “vote buying is that evil that if not addressed today is going to be worse than what we call corruption”.
