Protesters gathered in front of the military headquarters as military vehicles were deployed on key roads and bridges in Khartoum. They were reportedly shouting “It has fallen, we won,” Reuters said. Meanwhile, former and current Sudanese officials including Bashir’s former Vice President Ali Osman Taha and acting head of the National Congress Party Ahmed Haroun were reportedly arrested, as well as Bashir’s personal guards. Sources also said the Khartoum airport was closed.

“The Sudanese army will issue an important statement soon. Wait for it,” a television anchor said. Since Dec. 19, Sudan has been rocked by persistent protests sparked by the government’s attempt to raise the price of bread, and an economic crisis that has led to fuel and cash shortages
Opposition figures have called for the military to help negotiate an end to Bashir’s nearly three decades in power and a transition to democracy.
