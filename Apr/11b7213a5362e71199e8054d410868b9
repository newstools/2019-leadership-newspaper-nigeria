Justice Okon Abang of a Federal High Court, Abuja, yesterday adjourned till April 30, a suit  seeking the sack of Senate President, Bukola Saraki , Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara and 52 other lawmakers. An advocacy group, Legal Defence and Assistance Project, (LEDAP) dragged the lawmakers to court seeking a declaration that they were no longer members of the National Assembly having defected to other political parties before the expiration of their tenure. Defendants in the matter are 17 Senators, 37 members of the House of Representatives, the Independent National Electoral Commission, the Attorney-General of the Federation and the clerks to both houses. When the case came up yesterday parties were called to make their submissions. Counsel to LEDAP, Mr Jubrin Okutepa (SAN), argued that the case of whether a politician who moved from one party to another should retain his seat had been decided by the Supreme Court. Okutepa maintained that the defendants said they defected because there were divisions and crises in their political parties. On his part, Mr Mahmud Magaji, (SAN) counsel to Saraki and the other senators, argued that LEDAP was not part of the persons  referred to in Section 40 of the 1999 Constitution and so, they lacked the locus standi to file the suit. “They are not a registered political party so they are not protected by the section and there is nothing before the court to show otherwise.” “ It is also clear that they did not sponsor anyone for any election and they have not exhibited their membership card of any political party or evidence of voter card,” Magaji said. Justice Abang, however, adjourned the case for judgement.
