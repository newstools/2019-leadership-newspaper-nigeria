The world’s highest highway tunnel was open to traffic on Friday at an altitude of over 4,750 meters above sea level in southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region.

Gong Bin, Project Manager of the Mila Mountain Tunnel of the China Railway No. 2 Bureau, said that over 10 technological breakthroughs have been made in the course of the construction, such as improving the survey accuracy of mountain tunnels in extremely cold weather and at high altitudes. He said in addition to coldness and lack of oxygen, over 2,000 construction workers faced the challenges of the inconvenience of transporting living and construction materials to the site. “We have worked here for more than four years and lived in makeshift houses at the entrance to the tunnel,’’ Xu Yong, Party Chief of the construction project, said.
