The Kwara State House of Assembly has resolved to jettison the request for hand over notes by the Transition Implementation Committee set up by the Governor-elect in the state, Alh AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on the grounds that it does not conform with democratic tenets. In a resolution after exhaustive deliberations on the issue by the members, the Speaker, Dr Ali Ahmad described the committee’s request as anomalous as it amounted to setting  bad precedents  for the incoming lawmakers in the state. “The Kwara State House of Assembly noted that the letter from the representatives of the incoming executive requesting for hand over notes or brief from the Assembly was anomalous. “We hereby resolved that as a co-equal and separate arm of government that is not interested in receiving hand over note from any other arm of government, the Kwara State House of Assembly is not obliged under our laws to submit a hand over note or brief to any existing or incoming arm of government”, he said. The Speaker said that the autonomy of the legislature must be guarded, adding that to accede to the request of the Transition Committee would “kill the independence of the legislature”. All the members who spoke on the issue condemned the series of letters from the TIC requesting the House to furnish it with the handing over note or brief and described the request as illegal. It would be recalled that the House  had set up a three-man committee to liaise with the Transition Committee of the incoming administration on why the House would not honour the request. Submitting its report, the Chairman of the  committee, Hon. Kamal Fagbemi (Oke-Ogun Constituency) said the Transition Committee apologised for requesting for hand over note from  the legislature.
