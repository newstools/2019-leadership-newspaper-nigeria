The Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ) has called for the implementation of policies bothering on gender parity in media houses. The centre made this call during a capacity training on Investigative Journalism on Gender Policy organised by WSCIJ entitled: “Report Women! Female Reporters Leadership Programme” held at LEADERSHIP Newspapers in Abuja yesterday. Speaking during the training the managing partner, Eugenia Abu seeks empowerment of female reporters with skills, finesse, support and tools to take bold steps that help position them for the highest leadership positions in their media houses. ‘’There should be conscious effort to promote issues of women and the girl child, when there is inclusiveness there is balance and development,’’ she said. Abu who is an ace broadcaster said that the media has a lot to gain by reporting gender issues. She said gender mainstreaming requires concerted efforts from management, adding that gender balance helps in the effective maximization of resources. Speaking further she said a woman most time is already on the disadvantage, hence they should move same pace with men by positioning themselves for leadership position. ‘’Women should be encouraged to apply for jobs in the media industry and be given scholarships opportunity too, she said. Responding on areas to improve on gender practice and policy, the group executive director, Special Duties, LEADERSHIP, Mr Christian Ochiama said the paper gives equal opportunity to women. ‘’LEADERSHIP gives equal opportunity to women but the question is can you deliver? We have four LEADERSHIP titles, four editors, two women and two men,’’ he said. He added that all female journalists have the same opportunities and privileges as the male counterparts.
