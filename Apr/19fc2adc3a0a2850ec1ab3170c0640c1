Experts have tipped PayRent, a housing solution company, as a viable business that could thrive if given the needed support and as well as solve the nation’s housing challenge. This was disclosed at a business summit organised for young persons to pitch their business ideas and woo potential investors in Lagos on Tuesday. For his part, the CEO of PayRent Global Services, Mr. Oladimeji Solomon Adekanbi, said the company could do more in helping to reduce rent payment burden, help get vacant building in city centers occupied and also make landlords get rent with ease without issues. Speaking at the summit, Adekanbi said, “We are creating an avenue for property owners to get returns on their investments, while occupants of their properties do not need to go through the harrowing experience of raising rent in lump sum.” “With PayRent, the days of having unoccupied properties in the city are over because our service includes helping tenants spread out their rent across 12 months and we are reducing the number of unoccupied apartments, flexible property search engine, and Movers ‘n’ Relocates services, etc,” he added. Also speaking, a real estate expert, who was one of the moderators at the event, Akindele Olawale, said many young entrepreneurs, who have pitched their businesses at the conference have shown that Nigerian youths were thinking and making effort to create a better Nigeria for all. “PayRent is a good idea. I’m impressed with the idea and I must confess that it’s a viable idea that will help to proffer solution to housing problems in urban centers,” Olawale noted.
