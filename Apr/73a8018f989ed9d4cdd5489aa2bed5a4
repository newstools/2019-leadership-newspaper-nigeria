The vice-chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), Prof Benjamin Ozumba, has been honoured by the International Human Rights Commission (IHRC) for his role in the implementation of human rights in the institution. Rev Solomon Semaka, on behalf of the International Human Rights Commission’s Committee on Civil/Military Relations, Geneva in Switzerland, presented the award to him, yesterday. Semaka said that the nomination of Ozumba and his consequent emergence as winner in the academic category in West African tertiary institutions were made after painstaking review by the committee on issues of human rights in the university under Prof Ozumba’s leadership. While congratulating the university administrator for the award, Semaka noted that the committee, while validating the votes, which he earned through an online voting system and a panel of judges, discovered that among other qualities, “humility, transparency, accountability, dedication to duty and above all, the fear of God, were the virtues that capped the humanity in Ozumba.” He said:  “Your nomination and consequent emergence as the winner in the academic category in the entire West African tertiary institutions, perhaps, is as a result of painstaking reviews by the commission’s committee on issues of human rights in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka under your humble leadership. Let me add that our committee interviewed for three months, members of the university community for independent views, including students, staff and even the locals.
