The national chairman and presidential candidate of the Movement for the Restoration and Defence of Democracy (MRDD), Danjuma Mohammad has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to be magnanimous in victory by forming an all-inclusive government. Mohammad who argued that President Muhammadu Buhari has done well in his first term in office said it was necessary for the president to reconcile the nation after a keenly contested presidential election that polarised the country. Speaking to journalists yesterday  in Abuja, the party  chieftain who lamented the high level of division along ethnic and religious lines in the country noted that it was time for the president to unite the country through his appointments and even distribution of projects. While commending Buhari on the giant strides recorded in his first tenure in agriculture and infrastructure development , he also urged him not to relent in his fight against corruption. He said, “The president did very well in the election, he should do  more in the area of anti-corruption, infrastructure and agriculture.” On the leadership of the 9th National Assembly , he advised the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) to consider other zones that are not represented in at the national level for equity and balancing.” For me let each zone have representation at the national level, no geo-political zone should be isolated,” he added.
