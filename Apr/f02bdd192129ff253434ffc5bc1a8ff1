Five people are dead in the wake of major storms in Tajikistan. Three cattle herders were caught off guard by a mudslide and killed, authorities in the capital Dushanbe said on Thursday. The men went out with their cattle in the mountains despite storm warnings. Two men were fatally injured when rocks and debris fell on their cars. Civil defence officials in the Central Asian country brought close to 6,000 people to safety after a river threatened to burst its banks and flooded several villages following days of heavy rainfall. Schools in affected regions were also closed due to the risk of flooding.
