The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board(JAMB) has urged all candidates who recently took the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to guard their profile codes and registration number jealously to avoid falling prey to fraudsters. In its Weekend Bulletin, JAMB warned that registration numbers and profile codes were essential documents that should not be disclosed to unauthorised individuals. ” Candidates should know that what these fraudsters do is to take advantage of their naivety and subsequently obtain their registration number with which they print the examination notification slips which contain the candidates’ phone number with other vital data. “These fraudsters then use this information to send messages to some candidates disguising as officials of the Board or persons who have special information , access and capability to inflate the candidate’s scores among other things,” it said. It called on all the candidates to keep calm as the result has not yet been released, urging them to be wary of any dubious element trying to defraud them. “The Board will make it public when the result are ready. As such, the channels through which the candidates can view the  results has been communicated to them.  “In the meantime, security operatives have picked up some of these nefarious characters and they are on the trail of others still at large,” the JAMB stated.
