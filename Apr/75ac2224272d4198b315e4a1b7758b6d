The Kwara Chairman, Association of Nigeria Authors (ANA), Mr Abdulrahman Adebayo, has called for more recognition and merit awards for deserving authors in the country. Adebayo made this call in Ilorin on Thursday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said authors deserved more recognition and should be given special treatment like famous footballers and athletes in the country. “Authors have used their literary works to change people’s mindsets and also made some others to have hope in whatever they do. “It is time to appreciate authors and stop looking down on them. They have given Nigeria and Africa a clearer picture for the world to reckon with. “They deserve special recognition. They deserve a special statue for the upcoming generation to appreciate,” he said. He said Nigeria had produced great authors, who had portrayed the good image of the country in the past. According to him, the works of Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Ben Okri, Chimamanda Adichie and Cypran Ekwesi have laid a foundation to build upon by upcoming writers. He, however, called on the Federal Government, schools and the public to appreciate authors and accord them the respect they deserve.
