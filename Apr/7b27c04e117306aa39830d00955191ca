Speaking on the Group’s performance, the Group CEO of the company, Mr. Peter Ashade said “The quarter under review was indeed a challenging one of us as uncertainties around the 2019 general elections which took place therein plagued the capita market (equity and debt market) resulting in slower than expected economic activities in the Q1 of the year 2019.” He noted that this was responsible in part for the reduction in the issuance of registered bonds, promissory notes and commercial papers by te federal government, state government as well as local government. Going into the Q2 of 2019, Ashade expected that with the relative calm that followed the general elections, the pace of bond and commercial paper issuance would pick up from late second quarter to early third quarter of 2019. According to him, with shareholders interest perfectly etched on our minds, the group is confident that with its arsenal of time-tested strategies, its effort would begin to yield results in the coming quarter as we would be heading into the second quarter of 2019 with our heads held up high. “We would like to implore all stakeholders to be rest assured that we are on top of the situation as critical steps are being taken by top management to ensure a better result next quarter.”
