A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, yesterday, dismissed a suit challenging the nomination of Hon Lawal Mohammed Idrisu as member representing Ajaokuta federal constituency of Kogi State. Hon Okino Aloysius Adeiza of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had, on October 31st, 2018, filed a pre-election matter, challenging the qualification of Hon Idris, who ran and won election into the constituency under the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), alleging that he forged his National Diploma (ND) certificate, which was obtained from Yaba College of Technology, Lagos. Recall that Hon Adeiza had challenged same ND certificate at the tribunal and court of appeal in 2015 when he was defeated at the poll, but lost at both courts for lack of sufficient proof. In a writ of summons filed by counsel to the plaintiff, Reuben Egwuaba (Esq), the court was prayed to nullify Hon Idris’ nomination on the ground that his ND certificate was forged. In a preliminary objection raised by the counsels to Hon Idris, A A Ibrahim (SAN) and Tawada Adams (Esq), the court was urged to dismiss the suit as it was a clear abuse of court process and it was statured barred. In his ruling, Justice Taiwo Taiwo upheld the submissions of the counsel to the defendants. The court held that, since the issue of certificate forgery had been settled by the Tribunal and court of appeal in 2015 for lack of proofs, “the action is an abuse of court process and also statured barred”.
