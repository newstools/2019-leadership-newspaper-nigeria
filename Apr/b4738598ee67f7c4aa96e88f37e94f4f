As Christians across the country celebrate the death and resurrection of the Saviour, Jesus Christ, Cross River State governor, Senator Ben Ayade, has called on all faithful to imbibe the virtues of peace, love, sacrifice and forgiveness which he said represent the core values of Easter.  Ayade who made the call in his Easter message, signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Christian Ita, said: “Today represents a very significant moment in our lives as Christians. It is both significant and sobering in the sense that it reminds us all about the triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, love and compassion over hate. These were the cardinal planks of Christ’s teachings while on earth.”  Decrying the absence of compassion in today’s society, Governor Ayade quipped: “In many ways, our society today lacks compassion as a way to internalize and experience the inner soul of the other person and the universe. We need to reintroduce compassion so that humanity may survive.” According to the Governor, “In line with the compassion which Christ demonstrated by laying down his life for us, we should, therefore, replicate this to all men and continue to sustain it in the years to come.” While urging for constant prayers for peace to reign over Cross River and indeed, Nigeria, Ayade noted: “We must not forget that the peace we are enjoying today in the state is due, largely, to the prayers and support of all of you, and I urge you, in this season of Easter to continue in this momentum by upholding the values that seek to unite us rather than those that pull us apart.”
