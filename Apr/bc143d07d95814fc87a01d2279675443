A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Alhaji Ahmed Raheem, ((Lagaz) has warned politicians against interfering in leadership crisis of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the interest of the state. Raheem who gave the warning in Ibadan while speaking with journalists also tasked heads of the security agencies in the state to be at alert to forestall break down of law and order in the state in case the NURTW in the state decides to change their leaders on May 29, The PDP leader emphasized that any attempt by the politicians in the state to dabble into the issue of the NURTW leadership would surely threaten peaceful atmosphere in the state. According to him, the on-going issue on change of NURTW leadership hierarchy in Oyo State, “is solely between the members of the factions in the state. “NURTW is a union on its own. Though they have relationships with political parties, but politicians should not allow themselves to take up the position of their leaders or godfathers. “They have their way of doing their things and they all understand that way without crisis. I believe if politicians stay away during this period, peace will reign within them,” he said. The PDP leader added, “at the moment,  both the current chairman, Abideen Ejiogbe and Alhaji Lamidi Mukaila, a. k. a Auxiliary, know the traditional ways to settle the ongoing argument within themselves, and if it tarries, they can contact Abuja, their headquarters for truce. “
