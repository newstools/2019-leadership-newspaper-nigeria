The Chairman Senate Committee on Land Transport, Senator Gbenga Ashafa, have disclosed that the 8th Senate has provided requisite legislative framework for Federal government to execute the ongoing construction of Lagos to Ibadan standard gauge railway line through prompt appropriation of fund for actualisation of rail revitalisation master plan. This is addition to the government’s directive that all seaports, inland dry ports and river ports in the country should be connected to standard gauge railway line in other to decongest the Lagos port. Senator Ashafa, who disclosed this recently while speaking during visit of some members of Ghanian parliament, said the Senate ensured appropriation for critical rail infrastructure, particularly in the areas of counterpart funding and other ancillary costs for successive appropriation  till date. According to him, in order to also improve the business and commercial environment surrounding land transportation, he said, the Senate decided to carry out a complete overhaul of the enabling legislations guiding the industry, through passage of Nigerian Railway Bill 2015 which sought to separate the operations from the regulatory roles in the industry. Ashafa, explained that the passage of 2015 Railway Bill,  is against what currently obtains, whereby Nigerian Railway Corporation operates as both operator and regulator in the industry. He noted that with the present pace of work in the construction of Lagos to Ibadan standard gauge railway line, the rail mode will soon be dependable just as the second phase of the standard gauge rail project from Kano to Kaduna will commence immediately after completion of the Lagos to Ibadan rail project. The Senate Committee Chairman also spoke about plans by Federal government to connect all the state capitals by rail adding that currently government is seeking for partners to invest in the construction of Lagos to Calabar standard gauge railway line so as to meet transportation needs of the South East and South South.
