The National Union of Petroleum and Gas Workers (NUPENG) has urged the federal government to reject the advice given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on fuel subsidy. NUPENG also described the advice as poisonous. Speaking at a media briefing in Lagos over the weekend, the national president, NUPENG, Comrade Williams Akporeha, urged the government to heed to the advice of the union by shunning any counsel to remove fuel subsidy in other to avoid crisis that would destabilise or cause unnecessary tension in the country. He said: “Our over-dependence on petroleum products importation has unfortunately made us to be very vulnerable to antics and manipulations of local and international manipulators.’’ He stated that the union has requested for the revitalisation of the ailing refineries in order to pave for sufficient local supply of petroleum products across the country. He pleaded with President Muhammadu Buhari to use the strength of his second term in office to end the country reliance on imported petroleum products so as to meet local consumption. “Removal of subsidy is good but the country is not ripe for it for now as palliative measures must first be put in place in order to avoid hardship on the part of the masses,” he stated. He commended the executive and the national assembly for the passage and signing into the new minimum wage. He reiterated that there is no state in the country that does not have the capacity to conveniently implement this modest benchmark for workers in their respective states.
