The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has called on parents and caregivers to present their children for the ‘2019 African Vaccination Week’, scheduled from 22nd to 30th April, 2019. Speaking to LEADERSHIP on the exercise, secretary for Health and Human Services Secretariat (HHSS), Mallam Adamu Abubakar Bappah, expressed worry over the continuous outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in parts of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), despite the gains made in reaching children with vaccines. Bappah stressed the need to intensify efforts to ensure that all eligible persons receive the lifesaving benefits of vaccines in order for everyone to survive and thrive. He disclosed that to ensure that vaccination reaches all communities and children in the territory, the FCT team, as part of the 2019 campaign, would embark on continuous community sensitisation and mobilisation/immunisation services, with emphasizes on the value of vaccines for the health of children and communities in the FCT. The secretary explained that this year’s campaign, with the theme, “Protected Together Vaccines Work”, would celebrate vaccine heroes across FCT, from parents and community members to health workers and innovators, who have helped to ensure that we are all protected through the power of vaccines. Bappah pointed out that expanding access to immunisation is vital for achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), poverty reduction and universal health coverage. He continued: “Routine immunisation provides a point of contact for healthcare at the beginning of life and offers every child the chance at a healthy life from the earliest beginning and into old age’’. Immunisation is also fundamental strategy in achieving other health priorities from controlling viral hepatitis, to curbing antimicrobial resistance, and providing a platform for adolescent health and improving antenatal and newborn care.”
