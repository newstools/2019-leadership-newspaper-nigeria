A bill for a law to amend the Kwara State Local Government (Amendment) Law No. 3 of 2006 has been passed by the State House of Assembly. In the amended law initiated by the member representing Oke-Ogun constituency, Barr Kamal Fagbemi, it is now unconstitutional for the state governor to unilaterally dissolve democratically elected local government councils in the state. Speaking after the passage of the amendment bill into law, the deputy speaker, Chief Mathew Okedare, who presided over yesterday’s sitting, directed the Clerk of the House, Hajiya Halimat Kperogi, to prepare a clean copy for the governor’s assent, pointing out that the third tier of government is strategic to accelerating socio – economic transformation of the state. Speaking during the consideration of the general principles of the amendment bill, the sponsor, Fagbemi said the amendment became imperative in view of the fact that the principal law was inconsistent with the provision of the 1999 constitution. The lawmaker further averred that Section 7 of the 1999 constitution guarantees that local government shall be governed democratically, stressing that section 18 of the State Local Government Law No. 3 of 2006 was not in tandem with the provision of the nation’s constitution. The legislator cited the Supreme Court judgement in respect of dissolution of local government councils by Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, pointing out that the decision of the Supreme Court according to the 1999 constitution shall be enforced in any part of the federation by all authorities, persons and by courts of subordinate jurisdiction.
