The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, has said the commission’s school support programmes such as the digital awareness programme (DAP) and the advanced digital appreciation programme for tertiary institutions (ADAPTI), through which computers are supplied to secondary schools and tertiary institutions were created to support the acquisition and advancement of digital knowledge of students, their teachers and other members of their communities. He explained that similar programmes such as the school access programme, universities inter-campus connectivity programmes, and community communication centres carried out by the Universal Service Provision Fund (USPF), a department of NCC, were also created to address the gaps in ICT needs of the Nigerian people. Danbatta, represented by the controller of NCC, Port Harcourt zonal office, Venny Eze-Nwabufoh, made this known in his speech at the consumer outreach forum organized by the zonal operations department of NCC at Abak in Akwa Ibom State. The NCC boss told the participants that though the telecom consumer is king, “a knowledgeable and educated consumer is an empowered consumer”. He proceeded to inform them that the 2442- do not disturb code, the 622 toll free line, mobile number portability, data roll over, and the management of data renewal services are among several programmes of NCC initiated to improve the quality of consumer experience in the telecom sector. He urged the participants to take advantage of the values of those initiatives to enjoy seamless telecom services. Consumer conversation is an enlightenment programme designed to inform and educate the consumer about issues in the telecom sector and how the consumer is affected by the pace of developments. Besides information and educational exchanges, the forum enhances engagement with consumers in order to understand the challenges of the consumer and put in place processes to address them.
