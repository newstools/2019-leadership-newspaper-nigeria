Some Nigerian women have made case for the appointment of more women into political positions, in the next political dispensation for better development of the country. Speaking at a conference, titled, ‘Coalition for the Inclusion of Women in Good Governance’, held in Abuja, the guest speaker, Hajiya Binta Kanti, noted that over the years women have suffered gross neglect, discrimination and exclusion on rising from social cultural ideological construction of gender. Kanti pointed out women constitute half of the population in Africa, adding that their under-representation in social, political and economic spheres must be addressed if Africa is to leverage fully on the promise and potential that it holds. She stressed that any development process that ignores the life-chances of half the population cannot address the problem of poverty and the crisis of sustainability. Kanti stated that Nigerian Women are unhappy about the low number of women in 9th national assembly, adding that the few ones, particularly those who have cognate experience should be given equal principal positions office. She pointed that Hon. Khadijah Abba and Hon. Nkiruka Onyejiocha are women who have proven their worth in the national assembly, adding that they should be recognised for leadership of the senate and House of Representatives. The guest speaker further stated that economic empowerment of women is an important issue that should be taken seriously by families, communities, organisations and nations that are ready to make progress.
