The Counsel to Governor Umaru Al-Makura of Nasarawa State, Mubarak Adekilekun, has filed an application urging the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Lafia, to strike out Senator Suleiman Adokweâ€™s petition for filling out of time. The Counsel filed the application during the commencement of the pre-hearing session Tuesday in Lafia. According to him, the petitioner has filed his case outside the 21-days that a petitioner is expected to file his case from the date results of the elections were announced. Similarly, Hassan Liman, Counsel to All Progressive Congress (APC), had also filed application demanding the Tribunal to strike out the petition citing the same reason. Responding, Israel Usman, Counsel to Senator Adokwe, said he had just been served with the application at the Tribunal, he therefore needed time to file his response. The Counsel said that he would study the application and file his response within 24 hours.
