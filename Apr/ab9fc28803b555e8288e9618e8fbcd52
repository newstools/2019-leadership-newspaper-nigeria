The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD), said it has paid the sum of N375.9 million to 13,754 pensioners of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC). The payment was the final installment of the 30 months arrears of the 33 per cent pension increment that was confirmed by the management of NRC. It would be recalled that PTAD inherited outstanding 33 per cent pension increment liabilities from various agencies at the time of its takeover of payment of parastatals pension in 2015. Executive secretary, Sharon Ikeazor stated that the directorate inherited 30 months arrears of 33 per cent as at June 2015. However, between 2016 and 2018, 24 months arrears was paid to the pensioners of the Corporation leaving an outstanding balance of 6 months as at December 2018. With the latest payment, PTAD has settled fully the 33 per cent arrears of NRC. She assured other agencies that all arrears will be paid after the completion of Parastatals Pension Department (PaPD) verification exercise later in the year.
