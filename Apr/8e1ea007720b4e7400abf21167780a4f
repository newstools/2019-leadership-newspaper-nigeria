The First Bank of Nigeria Plc has upscaled the responsibility and knowledge of 17 of its senior personnel to boost competitiveness and satisfaction of its customers. Dr Adesola Adeduntan, Chief Executive Officer, First Bank of Nigeria, said this during the bank’s graduation ceremony for the second set of the Senior Management Development Programme (SMDP) on Tuesday in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Senior Management Development Programme (SMDP) was designed by the bank to help senior managers accelerate the demanding process of becoming outstanding General Managers and Executives. Adeduntan said the objective of the programme was to make leadership a common currency, while urging the graduands to promote excellence within their sphere of influence. “SMDP provides an empirical means of guaranteeing the bank’s leadership strength by deliberate inculcation of outstanding leadership into the bank’s culture. “An increase in the number of skilled senior managers places the bank at a competitive advantage both locally and internationally,” he said. He urged the graduands to maximise the knowledge acquired to boost the performance of the financial sector. Also, Andrew Alli, CEO, Southbridge Group, urged the bankers to uphold high standards and integrity in discharging their duties as custodians of the public’s fund. He advised them to maintain effective communication with their clients, stakeholders and regulators to promote a positive image of the bank.
