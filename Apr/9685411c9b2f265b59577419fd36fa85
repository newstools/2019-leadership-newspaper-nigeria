In his capacity as chairman of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of State, President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, directed the Honourable Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, to undertake an urgent mission as his Special Envoy to Guinea Bissau, in the company of ECOWAS Commission President, Jean-Claude Brou. President Buhari, in a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu, had, in response to an urgent request for assistance by the government of Guinea Bissau, graciously approved support to the country’s election process including 350 units of electoral kits, 10 motorcycles, five Hilux vans, two light trucks and $500,000. This vital assistance ensured that legislative elections held in Guinea Bissau, which should help in stabilising the country. In a separate development, Nigeria’s Foreign Minister will also undertake a mission to Cotonou, Benin, to deliver a personal message to President Patrice Talon from President Buhari. The visit is in the context of the brewing political crisis ahead of April 28, 2019, legislative elections in the country.
