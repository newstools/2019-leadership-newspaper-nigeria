Concerned Professionals’ Congress (CPC) has endorsed the Nigerian Military’s revised security strategy which was recently approved as a marching order by President Muhammadu Buhari to ruthlessly tackle all forms of criminality, killings, kidnapping, cattle rustling and armed banditry threatening the security of lives and property in parts of the country. It will be recalled that a fortnight ago, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin, in company of service and intelligence chiefs including the Acting Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, told State House reporters shortly after a high level security with President Buhari disclosed that a revised strategy was being rolled out to immediately deal with worrisome security situation in the country. The group’s chief media strategist, Emeka Nwankpa and its Northern Regional Rapporteur, Kasim Baba Kasim, in a statement in Abuja yesterday hailed the strategy and expressed confidence in the ability, capacity, resolve and resilience of the nation’s current military top brass to turn the tide against the present security challenges confronting the nation. According to the group, the nation’s armed forces is widely reputed for its amazing sense of precision, dispatch and ruthless efficiency in gallantry, courage and professionalism exemplified in international peace-keeping operations for which its officers and men had been continually garlanded several times. ‘’We are confident that the armed forces currently led by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin and the service chiefs working in synergy with other security agencies will soon give practical meaning, essence and impact to the recent presidential marching order to prove again that it is indeed one of the best fighting armed forces in the world’’, Nwankpa said.
