The apex Northern youth group, Arewa Youth Forum (AYF), yesterday accused the National leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of turning himself into a dictator within the party. Reacting to the ongoing National Assembly leadership tussle in a statement in Kaduna, AYF said the move by Tinubu to impose his lackeys on the members of the National Assembly is anti-democratic and against the interest of the north as a whole. The statement jointly signed by the national president, Gambo Ibrahim Gujungu and National Director, Public Affairs, Bello Abdulhamid said, “To any right thinking and close observer of the polity, this unfolding development showcases Bola Tinubu as anti-North and is selfishly paving the  way to have a total control of the APC and its tidings as well as influence the decision of the Party Chairman, all as a build-up to the 2023 elections.” The forum also said, “AYF has received with surprise, the recent position of the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, dictating who will emerge as the Senate President as well as the Speaker ,House of Representatives for the 9th Assembly. “We are also amazed by the statement credited to the Party Chieftain where he was quoted to posit that Party officials not comfortable with the choice and dictate of the party as orchestrated by him and some party officials are free to leave the APC. “So much so that we consider this statement as unbecoming of the National Leader. Also, we believe that this dictatorial tendencies are undemocratic, unethical, not in line with international best practices, politically incorrect and in bad taste.” Part of the statement also said, “An Elder who is supposed to toe the path of amicable resolution and embrace the spirit of reconciliation, particularly amongst the contestants, is openly found to be overbearing and divisive by all intents. “ The Arewa Youth Forum therefore, maintains that this singular action, especially as it affects the National Assembly, smacks of the problematic issue of influence of Godfathers, which overtime has been a serious draw back to the tenet of Good Governance because the so called ‘Godsons/Daughters’ are in shackles, enslaved and captive to the whims and caprices of their bosses; hence the desirous and ever needed delivery of Democracy Dividends through Good Governance is stunted and threatened”.
