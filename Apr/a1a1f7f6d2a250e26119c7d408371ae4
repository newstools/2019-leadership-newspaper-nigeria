The federal government has been called upon to establish a bureau of mines to ensure the development of the mineral sector in the overall interest of the economy. The appeal was made on Wednesday by a University of Port-Harcourt don, Dr Joseph Nwosu, who was presenting a paper on the topic: “Achieving Industrial Revolution through proper Development of Nigeria’s Mineral Base,” at the 2nd Metallurgical Industry Stakeholders’ Forum (MISF) with focus on the south-south zone which ended in Asaba, the Delta State capital same Wednesday. Nwosu, who however acknowledged that government has done a lot in the development of the institutional framework to move the sector forward, said the bureau of mines is the only critical institution now missing and causing untold setback to the industry. According to him, the bureau is the wing of the mineral drive mechanism responsible for solving technical problems of the sector. “The bureau should be a well established institution with zonal offices, and the staff should constantly visit the mines operations and collect the relevant technical data for proper calculation of productivities of these mines and the right royalty to be paid to government,” he noted. Nwosu, who was so concerned about lack of mechanisms to properly estimate the royalty that should accrue to government suggested that, in the interim, experienced mine planners can be consulted to do the job pending the establishment the bureau and training of staff.
