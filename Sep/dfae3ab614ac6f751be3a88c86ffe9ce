Speaking on the event, Waje said “I am so happy to do this; I would want to have this kind of event every year in order to bring alternative music to the fore front”. Waje’s scintillating voice and appearance endeared guests to her, as the crowd screamed and danced to her performance. She performed songs from her Red Velvet Album which included ‘Soldier, Be Mine, Got Sauce, Why’ and so many others. Highlights included Waje’s duet with Adekunle Gold for their song “Why” which got the audience on their feet, and then she brought the house down with her performance with MI of their song, “One Naira”. From Kaline’s sultry performance to Chike’s beautiful performance and Johnny Drille’s singing on stage, the show was indeed an amazing Affairs.
