Troops of Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have destroyed Islamic State West African Province (ISWAP) terrorists’ equipment and logistics in Tumbum Rego over the weekend. Chief of military public information, Col Timothy Antigha ,in a statement said the air interdictions conducted by MNJTF and National Air Task Forces successfully attacked and killed several fighters and knocked out equipment as they prepared to launch an offensive on troops location. He added that the battle damage assessment indicated that the air interdiction had a devastating impact, as pockets of ISWAP build up and logistics hidden under trees in Tumbum Rego had  been in ruins. In a related development, the troops also destroyed ISWAP assets in Mallam Zuberu and Alagarno, while many were killed. The statement added that in a similar move, improvised explosive devices planted by ISWAP operatives in Layi Koura area of Nguigmi in Niger Republic was discovered and defused by troops. He recalled that in the past couple of weeks, ISWAP suicide bombers struck in Kaiga – kindjiria; a rural community in the Republic of Chad as well as Gubio in Borno State, in an effort by ISWAP to revamp its dream of establishing a caliphate in parts of northern Nigeria and other areas of the Lake Chad Basin. This blow by the MNJTF would  further plunge the leadership and followership of ISWAP into more despair.
