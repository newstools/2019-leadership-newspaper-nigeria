House of Representatives Member for Sumaila/Takai Federal Constituency of Kano State, Hon. Mohammed Shamsuddeen Dambazau congratulated Nigerians on the country’s 59th Independence Anniversary admonishing citizens to take advantage of what unites them. Dambazau also stated that despite dunting challenges that the nation has experienced, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari administration is ensuring that no stone is unturned to bring the dividends of democracy, as witnessed in all sectors of the economy. In a statement issued Monday in Abuja, Hon Dambazau said that “today, we remember and hail our forebearers who fought for the independence and unity of our great country. “We also remember members of our Armed Forces, many of whom have paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend Nigeria’s territorial integrity and keep our country united”. “As a country, we must emphasize what unites us rather than what divides especially those that come under the guise of religion, politics, tribe and sundry groupings. “More importantly, I admonish Nigerians to engage only in acts that would heal to ensure tolerance and peaceful coexistence as this is the only pathway to our nation’s growth and development. “The President Buhari administration is committed to building on and affirming status as Africa’s leading light.”
