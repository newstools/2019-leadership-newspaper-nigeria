She explained that nurses are vital in health, care delivery system, playing a vital role in health promotion, prevention of diseases, treatment and care, stressing that the current shortage in manpower is taking a toll on nurses who sometimes have to work overtime to care for patients. She said, “Nurses are often the first and only health professionals that people see and the quality of their initial assessment, care and treatment is vital.
