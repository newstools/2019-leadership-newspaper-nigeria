The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Directorate of Road Traffic Services (DRTS), otherwise known as the Vehicles Inspection Officers (VIOs) has called on residents of the territory to support the directorate’s move to end the activities of Keke and Okada in Abuja city centre. Director of FCT-DRTS, Wadata Aliyu Bodinga, who made the call in an interview with LEADERSHIP at the weekend, noted that the operations of both the Keke and motorcycle riders in the FCT have become recalcitrant and constituted nuisance to other road users. Bodinga noted that if residents stop patronizing the operations of the Keke at the city centre, it will lead to the end of their activities. “If all of us decide to boycott the use of these Keke and Okada in the FCT, they will simply vanish, because they will go out of business. So, we are appealing to the general public to equally help us in this operation by desisting completely from patronizing these Keke and Okada, especially in the areas they have been banned, because they are not secured.” He revealed that the directorate has intensified its clampdown on the activities of Keke and Okada, adding that the arrest and prosecution of the operators at the city centre would continue until they are completely removed from the area. The director reminded residents that the activities of Keke have been restricted to the major housing estates in the territory. “We have always engaged the leadership of the group in this enforcement. And I can tell you that some of these operators are even above their leadership. And that is why they are becoming recalcitrant and ready to break the rules and regulations. There are some substantial numbers of these operators who are not members of he association.”
