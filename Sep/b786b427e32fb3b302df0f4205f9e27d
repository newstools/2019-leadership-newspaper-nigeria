The Lagos State Government has warned the concessionaires managing the Oko-Oba Abattoir to comply with the agreement reached with government by ensuring that the facility is managed properly in accordance with a proper hygiene culture. The Special Adviser to the State Governor on Agriculture, Ms Abisola Olusanya who gave the warning on Monday when he went on tour of the abattoir noted that the warning becomes imperative in order to ensure that Lagosians consume only wholesome meat from our abattoirs. He said, “We are very much concerned about the implication of consuming unwholesome meat.  We cannot toy with the lives of over 21 million Lagosians and that is why as part of our pro-active measures, the State Government will not condone any act of uncleanliness and lawlessness in meat processing and delivery in the State”, she said. The Special Adviser explained said that the vision of the present administration is to make Lagos a 21st century economy adding that attention would therefore be given to all areas of the food supply chain with emphasis on the consumption of wholesome meat by the citizen. She pointed out that an abattoir should be clean and free of dirt as it is the standard practice in advanced countries stressing that State Government is now encouraging private investment in the meat value chain with the licensing of more private investors to establish mechanised and semi-mechanised slaughtering and processing facilities in the state. Olusanya noted that  constant monitoring, compliance as well as enforcement will in turn prevent spread of diseases, promote data collection for planning, promote good animal welfare to make Lagos a safe place for all inhabitants by discouraging environmental pollution and health hazard.
