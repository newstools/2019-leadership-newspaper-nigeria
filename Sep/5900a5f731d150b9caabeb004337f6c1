The federal government has been advised to seek ways of making the airport environment conducive and the system work for the overall development of the sector rather than clamour for concession that is retrogressive. The chairman, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria FAAN branch of the National Union of Air Transport Employees NUATE, Comrade Adeshola Idowu who gave this advice in an interview with journalists in his office in Lagos said the aviation sector was yearning for positive transformation and not policies that will strangulate the its growth in the name of concession.He said: “We need development, concession is not the solution to the problems in the industry. We are not for concession and we are ready to work with anyone that will move the industry to next positive level.” According to Comrade Idowu, the next level of President Buhari will be supported by workers in the aviation industry only when it has the welfare and interest of workers saying that no worker will welcome next level of slavery He said there was no way concession will be done with the structure on ground adding that FAAN will not fall while the union will not fail the organisation. On the condition of service of FAAN workers, Idowu expressed joy that workers were not left behind as they were well taken care of by the management noting that promotion of staff were done accordingly while salaries were not delayed. He applauded the management of FAAN led by Capt Yadudu for being focus on the welfare of workers and the transformation of major airports. The NUATE FAAN chairman who was elected early this year, commended the FAAN boss on his transformations in the system in his 100 days in office saying that he has performed beyond expectations.Idowu said Capt Yadudu has continued to build on the existing programmes on ground before he took over the management of FAAN and assured of the union’s maximum support him to succeed.
