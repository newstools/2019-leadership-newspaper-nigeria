The presidency yesterday refuted claims in some quarters that President Muhammadu Buhari abandoned victims of a recent flood disaster in his country home of Daura in Katsina State Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said that Daura community, which was hit by massive floods last week, would receive more assistance from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). According to him, “contrary to the allegations that President Muhammadu Buhari has turned his back on the people of Daura, we can confirm that pre-assessment relief materials were dispatched to the victims within 48 hours of the floods. “Ten trailer loads of building materials including zinc, planks and cement, as well as tonnes of grains, cereals and other edibles have so far been delivered. The flood victims also received blankets and mattresses,” he said. Shehu added that materials were delivered to and signed for by stakeholders while the Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Faruk Umar, welcomed the prompt emergency response from NEMA officials. “NEMA has equally promised that in line with the establishment practices all over the country, as soon as the assessment of the damage to the flood-ravaged communities is reported, more food items and building materials would be dispatched,” he stated.
