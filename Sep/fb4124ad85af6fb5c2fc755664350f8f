The Coalition of Niger state Civil Society Groups and Youth Council of Nigeria has called on the federal government to as a matter of urgency take steps in addressing the deplorable state of roads in the state. Spokesman for the coalition, Comrade Mohammed Saidu Etsu, told newsmen at IBB pen house Minna that the present state of the roads was as a result of several years of neglect,  adding that residents are optimistic that it would be  addressed by President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. The groups who called for immediate intervention from the federal government, said the bad roads are signs that Niger state is continually being neglected even with the political support to all successive governments at the federal level. Mohammed Etsu  said that the roads have become death traps to motorists and is causing hardship to the people in the state and had affected economic activities. “The case of rehabilitation of the Minna-Bida road which attracts massive traffic has been in worse state these past weeks, that road is killing people everyday, in fact, we can say that Minna is totally cut off from Bida” he said According to him,  “We want the federal government to intervene in the Suleja-Minna road, Minna-Bida road, Lapai-Lambata-Bida road, Bida-Lemu-Zugeru-Tegina road, Gidigori-Kagara-mokwa road, Makera-Kontagora road, Kontagora-Yawuri road, Kontagora-Rijau road and Agaie-Baro road ,  we deserve  this because we massively  supported this government  through our votes in 2015 and in 2019. “ While noting that the state government has limited resources to tackle the deteriorating roads , he posited that the situation  has caused great setback to the economy  of the state. “Given the economic downturn, we are appealing to the federal government to intervene and complement the state government in building road infrastructure across the state” he declared. The youth leader said  “Continuous maintenance of federal roads is not a sustainable venture by a government that has a lot of electoral promises to fulfil in the face of economic difficulties. We are drawing the federal government’s attention to please live up to its responsibility.”
