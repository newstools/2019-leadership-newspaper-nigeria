Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has asked those residing in flood-prone areas to take necessary precautions to avoid loss of lives as torrential rain wreaked havoc in Osogbo, the state capital. The downpour which started Thursday evening through the night resulted in the overflow of Osun River, as a result of which some areas within the state capital were flooded. The upsurge of the river displaced many residents and destroyed properties worth millions of naira in the affected areas. In a public service announcement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Ismail Omipidan , the governor said government is already taking measures to further dredge the river. Some of the affected areas as at the time of filing this report include Gbodofon community, Awosuru area, Onitodunu Baruwa Area, Idowu Ajibola area, Oke Arungbo Estate(Zone 10&11 and Ibu-Amo community among others. Residents in the affected areas were caught unaware as the rain that started lightly around 5: 00 PM on Friday triggered serious flooding with resultant damage. It was gathered that the river surge could not allow the residents of the area to evacuate some of their belongings to a safer location. Eyewitnesses stated that the whole problem started in the midnight when residents were awoken by flood which started flowing into their houses. The flood victims have appealed to government at all levels to assist them in mitigating the effects of the flood.
