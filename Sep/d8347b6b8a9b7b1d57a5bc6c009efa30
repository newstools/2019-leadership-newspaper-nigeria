Egyptâ€™s fuel subsidy bill fell to around 85 billion Egyptian pounds ($5.15 billion) in the 2018-2019 financial year which ended in June from 120.8 billion Egyptian pounds ($7.31 billion) a year prior, a senior petroleum ministry official told Reuters on Monday. Egypt raised domestic fuel prices by as much as 50 per cent in June 2018 as part of an IMF-backed economic reform programme. It also hiked prices again in July 2019 by up to 30 per cent.
