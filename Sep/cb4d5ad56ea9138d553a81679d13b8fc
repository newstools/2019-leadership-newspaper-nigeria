The Head of Service to Oyo State Government Alhaja Ololade Agboola on Monday said the era of humongous and extravagant budget was over, saying the proposed 2020 budget would not only focus on the four cardinal principles and policies of the present administration which were education, health, security and economy but would also ensure its effectiveness in delivery of the dividends of democracy to the entire citizens of the state. She disclosed this in her keynote address at a one-day sensitisation workshop on year 2020 budget in Ibadan. To ensure easy planning, implementation and evaluation by the government and the people, the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mrs Olubamiwo Adeosun also said Oyo State government is set to adopt January to December for budget cycle for economic development of the state. Adeosun, who emphasized the need to promote strategic planning with the budgeting system, said the workshop was essential to educate and sensitise key officers in charge of budget on the need to focus on transparency in the budget process, which she maintained would ensure the realisation of the four-point development agenda of the Governor Seyi Makinde-led administration. She described budget as the financial mirror of government policies derived from strategic planning and enunciated to achieve developmental goals for the citizenry. The SSG called on the officers to see themselves as businessmen who should be all out to make profit on behalf of every citizen of the state. ”The budget is an economic and financial management instrument for allocating resources in order to achieve developmental objectives in an inclusive and sustainable manner and government primarily exists to provide livelihood for the populace, government is thus duty bound to provide quality service and public goods in the principle of equity and inclusiveness,’’ she said.
