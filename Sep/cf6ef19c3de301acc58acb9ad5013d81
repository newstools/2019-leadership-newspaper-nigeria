Engr.

He noted that Prof. Zulum does not only site projects at will but ensures that all projects have direct relevance to the need of the rural communities. The SDP Chieftain also acknowledged the Political leadership which the Deputy Governor, Alhaji Umar Usman Kadafur has given to the people of Southern Borno where he has single handedly eliminated opposition and rancour within the political class. He said  : ” Alhaji Umar Usman Kadafur has single handedly united all political fronts in Southern Borno through his leadership of accommodation to all. “I will be surprised if any political party will still be in existence in Southern Borno by 2023 because of the way the Deputy Governor is conducting his affairs”.
