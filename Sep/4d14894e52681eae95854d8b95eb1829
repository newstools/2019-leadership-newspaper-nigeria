Sunny Okoson, Ras Kimono, Marjek fashek, Fela kuti, Orits williki, Mandetors, to mention but few, fought for the freedom you enjoy today in your country through our music. why do you chose to pay us back by killing our people in your country?” the statement. He noted that the hundreds of SA students who ran to Nigeria for refuge. Nigeria single handedly spearheaded the fight against Apartheid, even when the UN and America did nothing, Nigeria took the fight very personal because of her Afrocentric Foreign Policy. “The jubilation and public holiday in Nigeria the day Mandela was freed. We felt Africa finally won. Still wondering, this is what Mandela fought and suffered for? institutionalising xenophobia as a policy in your country?”
