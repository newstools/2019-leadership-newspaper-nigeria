Nigeria and 15 other countries have been awarded the  “ICAO Council President’s Certificate” on progress in solving Aviation security. The award was also for oversight deficiencies and Nigeria’s commitment to the effective implementation of International Civil Aviation organisation (ICAO) standards and recommended practices. Director of press and public affairs of the ministry, James Odaudu said while presenting the certificate to the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika during the opening ceremony of the 40th Triennial Assembly of the International Civil Aviation organisation (ICAO) in Montreal,  Canada, President of the ICAO Council, Dr Olumuyiwa Bernard Aliu said the certificate was in recognition  of the contribution of deserving member states to the marked improvements in global aviation safety and security.
