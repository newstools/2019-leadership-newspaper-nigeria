The president of the Council of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Dame Olajumoke Simplice, has said the federal government was not getting as much as it should through taxation because of the many waivers it was giving. According to her, the claims that the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIR) was not meeting the target set for it, was due to the fact that the government did not create the right atmosphere for tax collection. Receiving members of the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) in Lagos, Simplice said the attack on the FIRS boss was unwarranted.The FIRS boss, Babatunde Fowler, had been queried by Abba Kyari, on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, on “significant variances between the budgeted collections and actual collections for the period 2015 to 2018 and FIRS’s inability to meet the target.”Fowler, in his response, attributed the variations to the low inflow of oil revenues for the period especially Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) which was due to the fall in the price of crude oil and reduction of crude oil production. Notwithstanding government efforts to diversify the economy, oil revenues remains an important component of total revenues accruable to the federation.Simplice stressed the need for government to look beyond oil for revenue saying “this country needs to move away from oil revenue and in fact, oil revenue has moved away from us and it is moving further away because the other countries are using electricity for cars now. So, where will we be if we do not develop taxation away from oil taxes.” Noting that government should not at this time be giving waivers, she said, the country was not yet ripe enough for such saying “government give waivers and they expect FIRS to perform magic, you can’t. The economic environment is not right. Companies are living Nigeria to relocate to Ghana and we are talking about somebody that has moved revenue to N5.3 trillion, the highest ever in the nation.”
