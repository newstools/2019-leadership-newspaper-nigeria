– Set to sign MoU with NCC The Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER) has praised the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for facilitating the liberalization of the telecom industry. The director-general of NISER, Dr. Folarin Gbadebo-Smith gave the commendation when he paid a courtesy visit to the commission’s headquarters in Abuja. He acknowledged that the NCC had been of considerable assistance to NISER over the years, noting that just recently, the institute received laptops from the commission. He further stressed that NISER is an agency, whose mandates cut across several aspects of national development and is into research for various ministries, department and agencies (MDAs), adding it planned to collaborate with NCC as “working together will advance the frontier of knowledge for Nigeria so as to compete effectively with neighbouring countries.” The NISER director-general, who was received by the director, policy, competition and economic analysis, NCC, Muhammad Babajika, on behalf of the executive vice chairman of the commission, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, equally commended the NISER boss for championing a research institute on behalf of all other agencies. He noted that “NCC will be part and parcel of working with NISER as President Buhari directed agencies of government to synergise, collaborate and have robust understanding and network to drive the Next level Agenda.” “A step in the right direction would be to look at our needs, put heads together and have a memorandum of understanding (MoU) so that we can assist each other by creating a small group to identify our needs and advise us accordingly on areas of collaboration,” he said.
