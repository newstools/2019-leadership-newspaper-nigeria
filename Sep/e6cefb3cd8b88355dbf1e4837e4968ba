Students of the Benue State University, Makurdi (BSU) yesterday staged a protest over alleged implementation of the new five points grading system by the school management, as directed by the National Universities Commission (NUC). Recall that last Monday, the students protested over what they described as ‘poor medical attention and safety of the life of the President of the National Union of Benue State Students, (NUBESS), Comrade Smith Tyonor who was shot around the University community by unknown persons. The students yesterday blocked all the main entrances of the University as early as 6am, demanding that the management must revert to the four (4) point grading system. Following this action, the Senate of the institution met at the Vice Chancellor’s private residence located inside the Commissioner quarters in Makurdi, the State capital and issued a directive that the University be closed with immediate effect to avoid further breakdown of law and order in and around the University campus. In a statement after the meeting through the registrar, Dr Mfaga Modom, explained that the university is aware of the students’ grievances as relates to five points grading system and has constituted a committee to consider their appeal. “The committee requested and received memoranda from the university community including students and its reports is to be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the senate scheduled to hold on the 5th of this Month” She disclosed that the university had already complied with the directives of the National Universities Commission (NUC) by reverting to the five points grading system, with effect from the 2018/2019 academic session. While describing the closure of the two gates of the university by students as unwarranted, the management also appealed to students to be law-abiding and respect constituted authority, policies and properties of the institution and allow due process to prevail. “We wish to state clearly that the school management cares for the students’ academic success and will never in any way do anything deliberately to distort their academic performance and results.”
