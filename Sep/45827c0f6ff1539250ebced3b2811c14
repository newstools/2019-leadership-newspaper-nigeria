The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) says it arrested 16 suspects drug dealers and recovered 672.6g of substance suspected to be hemp during a raid in Dutse. Mr Oko Michael, the Deputy Commandant in charge of Operations and Intelligence in the Jigawa Command of the agency, made this known to newsmen in Dutse on Monday.
