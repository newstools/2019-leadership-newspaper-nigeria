The Nigerian Army says troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force have neutralised seven key Boko Haram/Islamic State West Africa Commanders and many others at the Tumbus area of Lake Chad region. Following the jubilation mode in the military camp, the acting director, Army Public Relations, Col Sagir Musa, in a statement said it was a period of mourning and monumental set back to the erstwhile Boko Haram/ISWAP fighters hibernating at the triangular area of the region. He quoted a reliable source from the inner circles of the demented and criminal group’s enclave that they are escaping to Sudan and Central African Republic, indicating that the superior forces of the MNJTF have wasted at least no fewer than seven key commanders. The neutralised commanders were named as Abba Mainok, Bukar Dunokaube, Abu kololo, Abor Kime (said to be of Arab origin – likely their ISIS trainer), Mann Chari, Dawoud Abdoulaye (from Mali) and Abu Hamza. He said the above named terrorists were said to be commanders of various Tumbus-controlling fighters before they were decisively dealt with and sent to the pit of hell by the military bombardment. “Although these names may not be real and may likely be nicknames, nonetheless, it is an unprecedented feat to our quest of clearing the remnants of these criminals in the area,” he said He said efforts are currently ongoing to get more information on their true identities. Meanwhile, the chief of army staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai, through the theatre commander, Multinational Joint Task Force and the commander, Operation Lafiya Dole, has commended the troops for the great effort and enjoined them to do more.
