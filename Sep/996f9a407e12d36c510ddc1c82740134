She assured the populace that the state government would not relent in its efforts to rid the state of quackery and illegal operation of facilities, explaining that part of the strategies employed by the agency that made it record a level of success included consistent surveillance and monitoring of health facilities in the state, support by members of the public as well as placement of adequate sanctions against those who fail to adhere to standards. Abiola urged members of the public to continue to cooperate and support the government in the fight against quackery and illegal operation of facilities by reporting those behind such acts to relevant government agencies to safeguard the health and well-being of the citizenry.
