Following the flood red alert’ issued by the Nigerian Hydrological Services Agency (NHISA) on prospect of a possible flood some states of the Federation, the Nigerian Agricultural Insurance Corporation (NAIC) has called on Nigerian farmers to strictly adhere to best agricultural practices, thereby closing gaps of risk occurrence. NAIC’s managing director/CEO, Mrs. Folashade Joseph made the remarks yesterday in a statement that was issued by the head, corporate affairs department in the agency, Magdalene Omosimua. Mrs. Joseph underscored the need for farmers to keep abreast of the impact of the heavy rains which is expected between now and October, 2019. While advising farmers, especially those covered by the corporation’s Insurance on best agricultural  practices, she noted that farmers have already been educated during various farmers sensitisation programs on how to maintain sound house-keeping on their insured projects. She further reminded the farmers that NAIC was specifically set up to indemnify farmers that insured their farms with the Corporation and that given the nationwide spread of NAIC branches which are located in the 36 states of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). She added: “It is wise for every investor across the agricultural value chain to take a NAIC cover as the corporation ploughs farmers back to prosperity.’’
