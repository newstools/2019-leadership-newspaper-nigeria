The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has demanded that the South African government provides appropriate compensation for Nigerians who were attacked by south Africans in the latest round of Xenophobic attacks The Congress in a statement by its President, Ayuba Wabba said Nigerian workers hold the South African government squarely responsible for failing in its duty to protect or safeguard the lives and properties of foreign nationals, especially Nigerians who have been subject of attacks over time. He therefore said South African must give an assurance that this will never happen again not only to Nigerians but all foreign nationals in South Africa. Wabba while condemning the attacks in South Africa which he described as “beastly and unacceptable” said the frequency and escalation of these attacks are not only reprehensible but are capable of undermining the illustrious bilateral relations between the government and people of Nigeria and government and people of South Africa. He however said as despicable as these attacks are, “we will advise against crude retaliatory measures such as the burning down  of perceived South African businesses in Nigeria, for in reality, some of those businesses are owned by Nigerians.” He therefore appealed to Nigerians to leave the matter to the Nigerian government which has acted properly by dispatching an envoy to South Africa to express its displeasure as well as  table its demands.”
