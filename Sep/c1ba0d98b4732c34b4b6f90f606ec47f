Muller expressed satisfaction over the huge investment put into the Hotel, adding that it is a positive one.“What has made me so happy about this investment is the business potential. Initially, when we came to the country, Nigeria was experiencing economy crash and a lot of our hotels were under construction during that period. “However, recently, we have noticed a lot of flights coming into Nigeria when compared to 2009 and 2010. More people are visiting Nigeria. For the past nine months, we have noticed surge in the movement of people into the country,” he said. Located in the industrial and commercial hub of Lagos state, Muller revealed that The Providence By Mantis Hotel has a modern design, elegant lines and bold colours, adding that luxury and class, complemented by exemplary service are what make the hotel stands out, despite many hotels at Ikeja GRA.In the same vein, the chairman, The Providence By Mantis Hotel, Hyacinth Oseji said “Whenever I come to Ikeja, I find it difficult getting a quality hotel with all the required facilities. This was what brought about The Providence By Mantis Hotel with a good concept.
