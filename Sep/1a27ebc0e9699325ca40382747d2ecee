We are tired of paying for light we did not consume “”, he said angrily. Another protesting youth,Ibrahim Abubakar said they were at Government House to register their complaint against KEDCO. He appealed to the Governor to intervene before people completely lose their patience. He described the attitude of Kaduna electricity company as unfortunate and uncalled for despite the millions of naira Kebbi State Government was paying to support constant supply of power to people in the state. Earlier, journalist contacted the Business Development Relation Officer of the company, Dogara Saidu in his office on the epileptic power supply in the state but declined to make comment on the matter saying that until he secures permission from his head office. It will be recalled that governor Bagudu had approved the release of 154 million naira to Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) in April this year in order to maintain uninterrupted power supply to Kebbi State.
