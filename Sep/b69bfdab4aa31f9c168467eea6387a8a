Farmers within and outside the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have been advised to embrace electronic commerce (e-commerce) in order to ensure good marketing and profit on their farm produce and boost the nation’s economy. Tunji Iranseoluwa, chief executive officer of Lifezgreen Diamond Acres Limited, who made this known during the unveiling of Nigerian first agribusiness e-commerce platform in Abuja on Saturday, said that e-commerce will also also make it easy for rural farmers to export their produce outside Nigeria. Iranseoluwa said that despite the quantities of farm produce in Nigeria, farmers have been unable to fully get appropriate market for it, thereby leading to shortages for them. According to him, farmers need to give less attention to analogue means of marketing that produce and move with the trend, by adopting e-commerce in getting suitable markets and patronage for their produce and products. “The problem is the market in Nigeria, Nigeria grows the highest quantity of yam but unable to export. Look at what is happening in Ghana. Nigeria grows more yam than Ghana so we need a seamless system to make exporting of farm produce work that is what we are bringing in. “We are going to the e-world whether we like it or not. We need agricultural technology and we must move with the trend. Technology has made everything easier so for the rural people it is just a matter of sensitisation,” he said. He said the group would also collaborate with some local governments in the country to engaging and training farmers adding that they need not have internet because they tap into e-commerce. “We will partner with the local governments so that even if the farmers in the villages cannot access internet he knows what to do by meeting our agent and selling to them, so that their produce and products could go global,” he said.
