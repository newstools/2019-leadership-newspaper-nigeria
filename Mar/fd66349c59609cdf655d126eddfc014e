The Senate approved N30,000 as the new national minimum wage. This decision was reached on Tuesday after the upper chamberâ€™s ad-hoc committee on new minimum wage headed by Senator Francis Alimikhena submitted its report. The Senate then went on to request the Federal Government to submit a supplementary budget to cover the new wage structure for consideration and approval.
