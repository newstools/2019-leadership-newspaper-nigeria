The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has refused to give a certificate of return to Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha as senator elect. It was alleged that Okorocha had ‘forcefully’ asked an INEC official to declared him winner of his Senatorial district contest. The incident angered INEC chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu who said that any candidate that forced it’s official to announced him or her winner in an election will not be given a certificate of return. Without certificate of return, it means that the election has not been validated. But while distributing certificate of return to elected Senators from the South-East, INEC National Commissioner, Prof Okechukwu Ibeanu only announced Francis Uzenwa Onyewuchi as the only Senator elect for Imo state. Francis Uzenwa Onyewuchi will represent the people of Imo East senatorial district at the red chamber. Earlier, INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu said the commission will continue to work with members of the National Assembly to review the electoral laws ahead of the 2023 general elections. Yakubu who urged all the senators elect to work ahead of time in reforming the electoral laws, said vital lesson learned from one elections to another are lost if the reforms comes very close to another general elections. The distribution of the certificate is presently ongoing at the International Conference Centre, the venue of the national collation centre. Members of the green chambers elected in the 2019 presidential and national assembly elections will get their certificates of return by 2pm today.
