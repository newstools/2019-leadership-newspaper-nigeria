President Muhammadu Buhari has said that Kano has been his political hub since joining the Nigerian political terrain in 2003. President Buhari said that Kano has always given him succour even when he did not triumph. The president stated this when a delegation from Kano South paid a congratulatory visit to him in Abuja. President Buhari said that he cannot thank Kano people enough for standing with him in good and bad times. He expresses appreciation for their support and prayers. The President thanked Senator Kabiru Ibrahim Gaya for all his support explaining that his performance as chairman Senate Committee on Works added to the many achievements of his administration for the past four years. Earlier, Senator Kabiru Ibrahim Gaya (APC Kano South), who led a powerful delegation to the president at Aso Rock to congratulate him on his re-election in the just concluded presidential election, appealed to the president to speed up the completion of the Port-Harcourt-Kano and extension of Kaduna-Kano rail line to ease inter-state haulage of goods on the road. Senator Gaya also told the President to urgently look into awarding the contract for the construction of overhead bridge at Mariri in Kano Central Senatorial District where scores of lives have been lost as pedestrians struggle to cross the highway. Senator Gaya used the occasion to thank Nigerians for voting overwhelmingly for the ruling party at the just concluded presidential polls and Kano south for re-electing him to the senate for the fourth time.
