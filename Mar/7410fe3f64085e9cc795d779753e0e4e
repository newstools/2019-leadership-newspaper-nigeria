Mother of new born baby realised she left her baby at the departure waiting hall after aircraft had taken off at the Saudi Arabia International Airport. In rare cases, mostly a major emergency, flights are generally cleared to return to airports to collect a forgotten item. A strange emergency case ensued at Saudi Arabia’s King Abdulaziz International Airport after a woman forgot her new born baby at the airport. According to Gulf News, despite being naturally connected to a baby as a mother, the unidentified woman boarded the Saudi Arabian Airlines flight without a worry in the world. She only realised she had left her baby at the departure waiting hall after the aircraft had taken off from the airport. On suddenly realising her blunder, she informed the cabin crew she had forgotten her baby at the terminal forcing the pilot to turn Flight SV832 from Saudi Arabia’s capital city, Jeddah, to Kuala Lumpur back. The incident shocked not only the crew but also other passengers and Air Traffic Control (ATC) operators. The video of the pilot requesting ATC operators to return to the airport has since gone viral on social media with many wondering just how does one forget her baby. “This flight is requesting to come back…a passenger forgot her baby in the waiting area, the poor thing,” the pilot can be heard in the video. The ATC executives spent several minutes figuring out the protocol to be observed during such incidents. “Ok, head back to the gate. This is totally a new one for us!” says one of the ATC operators. The woman was finally reunited with her baby at the airport.
