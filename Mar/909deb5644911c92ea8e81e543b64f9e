The Southern Nigeria People Mandate (SNPM), a Non-Governmental Organisation, has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari on his plans to probe 16 billion dollar failed power project.  It will be recalled that the project spanned over the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration.  The President of SNPM, Mr Augustine Chukwudum, gave the commendation in a statement issued to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Wednesday.  Chukwudum also called on Buhari to also probe 20 billion dollar allegedly misappropriated by former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration when Emir Lamido Sanusi of Kano was governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  He alleged that Sanusi was removed from office because he blown alarm concerning how 20 billion dollars was moved by the then Jonathan’s administration.  “We want President Muhammadu Buhari to march his word with action because during 20l5 and 20l9 campaigns, he promised to fight corruption.  “Nigerians will not be happy with him if he fails to probe and recover these monies,’’ he said.  According to him, these monies totaling 36 billion dollars being probed and recovered by the government will prove to Nigerians that there is no sacred cow.  “This time, Buhari’s administration must prove to the world that he is serious in fight against corruption.  “SNPM demands that President Buhari should use every power within him as president to recover all these monies; while anybody culpable must be punished.  “Let every right thinking Nigerian support President Buhari on this wonderful plan,’’ he said.
