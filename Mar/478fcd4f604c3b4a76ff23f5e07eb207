No fewer than 20 gubernatorial candidates in Zamfara State have withdrawn their candidature for the contest of the March 9 governorship election. Speaking while presenting the list of the political parties stepping down for the election, APP governorship candidate, Hon Zayanu Salisu, said the decision was borne out of their desire to join hands to develop democracy in the state. “We are convinced that, based on the development recorded by the government, we have no option other than to support the ruling party in the forthcoming election”, he added. He said that already, leadership of the parties have directed their members to vote for the APC during the governorship and state assembly elections. In his response, Governor Abdul-Aziz Yari thanked them for their support and promised to have an all-inclusive government.
