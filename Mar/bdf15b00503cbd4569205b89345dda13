The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) and the Nigerien Air Force in the joint efforts to provide air support to ground troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have neutralised 33 terrorist fighters, destroyed their equipment and recovered weapons. The director of Public Relations and Information, NAF, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola said the joint multi-national operation is aimed at routing remnants of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in the Lake Chad Basin area. He noted, “NAF Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and Alpha Jet attack aircraft, working in synergy with ISR platforms and attack aircraft from the Nigerien Air Force, supported surface troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) to pursue and decimate fleeing ISWAP fighters around Tumbun Rego area on the fringes of Lake Chad in the northern part of Borno State on 12 March 2019. “The effectiveness of interdiction and close air support missions conducted by the attack aircraft of the two countries facilitated the routing of the terrorists at Arege, resulting in the killing of 33 fighters, destruction of some terrorists’ equipment as well as the recovery of an array of weapons and equipment.” The director said that the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole has continued to provide airlift support to troops of national contingents of Operation Yancin Tafki. He stated that the development has enhanced liaison between the various commanders and facilitated visits to forward locations. He said the NAF ISR platforms and helicopters are also providing aerial command posts for enhanced coordination of close air support missions as well as fire control support for ground artillery bombardment of terrorists’ positions. He further reiterated that the NAF working in concert with allied air and surface forces, will continue to sustain its efforts to support all operations in the Northeast.
