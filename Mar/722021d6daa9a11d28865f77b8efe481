Troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in its determination to unhinge the structures of Boko Haram and dismantle its terror networks in the Lake Chad Area, have intensified air interdiction and mop up activities in the Area of Operation leading to the neutralisation of 33 Boko Haram Terrorists and recovery of large cache of weapons. A statement by the Chief of Military Public Information Col Timothy Antigha said, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platforms as well as ground attack aircraft from a coalition of Cameroonian, Niger and Nigerian Air Forces intercepted and destroyed Boko Haram Terrorists in Tunbum Rego, a prominent island in Lake Chad, believed to harbor High Valued Boko Haram Targets. He noted that in a related development, MNJTF troops from Sector 4 attacked Boko Haram assets in Arege, killing scores of terrorists in the process. He gave the breakdown of casualties on the part of the terrorists to include, 33 terrorists killed in Action, two Gun Trucks recovered, one Amoured Personnel Carrier destroyed, two Motor Cycles destroyed, one 120MM Motar Tube recovered, twelve AK 47 Riffles recovered, two 60MM Motar Bombs recovered, 3736 rounds of assorted ammunition recovered, one Binocular recovered and two Hand Grenades recovered. The MNJTF therefore warned individuals associated with Boko Haram to surrender themselves for demobilization and rehabilitation, while the opportunity still exists.
