Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state has declared that he is not in hospital coma, saying his driver is not dead as been speculated. There was mild speculation that the governor involved in a fatal road accident. But on his official Facebook page, el-Rufai wrote: “I woke up after a rare 8-hour bout of deep sleep to learn that some bigotry-driven, PDP-affiliated fake news platform has declared my driver dead and my humble self in coma. Both claims are false. “I thank them for reducing the days in their lives and adding them to mine. I remain their permanent nightmare and not about to disappear from their wretched and corrupt lives any time soon by the Grace of Almighty Allah, until they are permanently retired and buried. – Nasir @elrufai,” the governor said.
