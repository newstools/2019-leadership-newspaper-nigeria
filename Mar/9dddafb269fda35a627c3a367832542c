Barr. Omosede Igbinedion, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Ovia Federal Constituency, has filed a petition before the Edo State Election Petitions Tribunal asking it to declared her winner of the February 23 National Assembly Election for Ovia Federal Constituency. Omosede said she won majority of lawful votes in the election. Her opponent in the All Progressives Congress, Hon Dennis Idahosa, was declared winner of the election and has since been issued with Certificate of Return. In a chat with newsmen in Benin City shortly after submitting her petition, Barr. Omosede said she has several grounds to challenge the outcome of the election because she performed creditably well. Omosede noted that the results were not a true reflection of the people of Ovia Constituency as there was no reasons for her to lose the election. Her words, “There are several grounds which we intend to challenge the election. First thing is the candidate of the APC. There are so many things we know that tell us he was not worthy to contest the election. “We want to contest the results which was not a reflection of Ovia Constituency. The people of Ovia came out to vote for the PDP. Where the discrepancies came from in Ovia South West were unfounded. I have several projects and there was no reason for us to lose the election. “This mandate will be recovered. I was deeply saddened when I saw elected National Assembly collecting their Certificate of Return and the person was sitting in the back seat. That is not supposed to be the position of Ovia Constituency. “We are going to prove that he is not worthy to be at the House of Representatives. I am asking the tribunal to declare me the winner.”
