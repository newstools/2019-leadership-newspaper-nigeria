Prince Dapo Abiodun, candidate of the All Progressives Congress has posted an appreciation of Almighty God and the people of Ogun state ahead of his official declaration as governor-elect by the Independent National Electoral Commission. Collation of the results, council by council, is still ongoing in Abeokuta, but all indications point to his victory over Abdulkabir Akinlade, candidate of Governor Ibikunle Amosun, who ran on the platform of the Allied Peoples Movement and Senator Buruji Kashamu of the Peoples Democratic Party. In a post on Twitter, Abiodun wrote: “Unspeakable Joy. Limitless Happiness.We are GRATEFUL to GOD Almighty and the good people of Ogun State”. Abiodun similarly sought God’s favour when he voted on Saturday. “I VOTED. May the Almighty God grant us VICTORY!” And he got the victory not surprisingly as the Ogun State people rejected overwhelmingly Amosun’s stooge, Akinlade and Senator Kashamu. From results declared so far, Abiodun led in Odeda, Ijebu East, Sagamu, Odogbolu and Ijebu-Ode, Abeokuta South local governments.
