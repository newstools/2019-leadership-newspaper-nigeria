The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, condemned the invasion of the Abuja residence of Taraba State governor, Arc Darius Ishaku, by police operatives alleged to have been detailed by presidential authorities. The party said the invasion is unlawful, provocative and cannot be justified under any guise whatsoever. The PDP, in a statement by its national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, insisted that such assault on a governor’s residence was a  direct attack on the nation’s democratic order and must not be swept  under the carpet like previous invasions of residences of some PDP elected officials under the domineering All Progressives Congress (APC) administration. “Our party holds that the invasion of Governor Ishaku’s residence is  criminal and in total violation of the spirit of the immunity clause  under the 1999 Constitution (as amended).
