My wife rushed out and from there I head her shouting that I should come out. When I joined her, I saw about nine motorcycles carrying people who were shooting sporadically. “They are the herders that have been fighting with the Kona people. The man in front with a different motorcycle was someone who knows the area very well,  he was directing them on the houses to burn down. “They were burning houses and shooting, people were running away, though I can’t tell if someone got bullets wounds or killed in the process, but several houses were bunt.
