Governorship candidate of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) in the just-concluded general elections in Rivers State, Victor Fingesi, has expressed concern over the deteriorating state of security as well as flood ravaging the state. He said after the elections that hoodlums were having a field day in different parts of the State and that a lot of people have been kidnapped, murdered and ransom obtained from the already impoverished people of the state. Fingesi, who spoke at the second anniversary of the ADP in Port Harcourt, said containing insecurity is not what should be left in the hands of the local governments only and not even the threat of removing traditional rulers could address it. He advised the Rivers State government to convoke a non-partisan security summit of Rivers people and stakeholders to come up with the necessary panacea to contain the situation. The ADP gubernatorial candidate further advised the State governor not to play politics with security as it pays nobody any good. On the flood ravaging the state, Fingesi advised the state government to be decisive and make way for drainage routes. He said buildings blocking the drainage routes should be made to go down to save the state from embarrassment. The governorship hopeful also said no part of the state capital is free from flood including the Government Reserved Areas (GRA). Fingesi said although he had a clear cut vision on how to arrest flooding in the state, in the interest of Rivers state, he wouldnâ€™t mind offering the idea to the Rivers State government to address the ugly situation so that every Rivers man would be happy. He stated that flood has caused a lot of damage to property and even lives in the state and wondered why a rich state like Rivers state would turn its back on it. The ADP leader said what was lacking was the political will to deal with the challenges and called on the state government to do the needful.
