A former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Adebisi Akande, has accused some Yoruba leaders of plotting to cause religious and ethnic conflicts despite their age-long connivance with other nationals to cause set back for the country. Akande, who spoke in Ede at the unveiling of Karele Oodua Logo and Investiture of Karele Oodua Ambassadors, organised by Osun State Ministry of Home Affairs, Culture and Tourism, noted that it is criminal for such leaders to blame Nigeria’s socio-economic predicament on a particular religion or ethnicity. “It is a fraudulent and ungodly tradition to join the corrupt North and East of Nigeria in throwing Nigeria into an economic perdition and begin to call on those of us who are innocent to give chorus to your songs in blaming the criminal consequences on a particular religion or ethnicity,” he said. While lamenting the unprecedented migration of Yoruba youths to foreign lands, Akande blamed the development on some selfish Yoruba leaders who depressed and degraded the authentic aspirations of the Yoruba people. The former governor said the consequence of the actions of these Yoruba leaders in connivance with their Northern and Eastern counterparts metamorphosed into the disunity of the country and the promotion of religious conflict, which resulted in the migration of the Yoruba people to the diaspora. Akande, who warned that the result of using politics to generate religious wars would continue to send numerous other Yoruba Youths into diaspora in a most undignified fashion, commended efforts of the Osun State government to encourage the pilgrimage of Yoruba in the Diasporas back home.
