The Nigeria Association of Auctioneers (NAA) has called on President Muhammed Buhari to speed up the process of disposing of the ‘’recovered forfeited assets’’ by open competitive sales to avoid waste, loss of revenue and irregularities in the sales. LEADERSHIP reports that the federal government has disclosed that it will commence the sale of all the assets recovered in the course of the battle against corruption by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. In his address during a press conference, yesterday in Abuja, the president, NAA, Alhaji Aliyu Kiliya also said that the swift sales of the forfeited asset in line with global practices will protect the image of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government. According to him, “We are among follower of events in the Country and supportive of the Government that is why we want the Government to engage the services of our members the Nigeria Association of Auctioneers to speed up the process of disposing of the Recovered Forfeited Assets by open competitive sales.’’ Kiliya decried that silent and delay on sales of the recovered forfeited assets by the federal government is dangerous to the economy as the proceeds can be used to fund the nation’s budget. “Nigerians want to know who is responsible for the delay in engaging professional auctioneers to sales the recovered assets forfeited to the federal government and other unserviceable assets. “It’s over six months since the President has given directives so why the silent, criminal elements will be busy evacuating the larger chunk of the items for themselves while leaving remnants and unserviceable behind for the government,’’ he said. Kiliya further stated that the federal government is losing billions of naira in the sales of railway scraps for not engaging the association to sale the items by an open competitive system of sales.
