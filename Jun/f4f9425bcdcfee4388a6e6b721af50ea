The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the World Health Organisation in Nigeria (WHO Nigeria) and other partners, have said that the emergency phase of the 2019 Lassa fever outbreak has ended. Recall that the NCDC, on January 22nd, 2019, activated a national Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) to coordinate response activities in the face of rising Lassa fever cases across the country. In a statement jointly signed by the NCDC and WHO, they said following a robust response, the Lassa fever case count has significantly declined in the past seven weeks and has now dropped below levels considered to be a national emergency. According to the statement, “This year, there was also a decline in case fatality rate of Lassa fever, from 27 per cent in 2018 to 22 per cent in 2019. “Despite the end of the emergency phase of this outbreak, NCDC expects that sporadic cases may continue to be reported in endemic areas/hotspots and the agency will now coordinate preparedness and response activities through a multi-sectoral Lassa fever Technical Working Group. “The group’s focus is to continue monitoring cases, as well as improve disease prevention, surveillance, diagnosis and response activities across all levels in Nigeria.” According to the director general, NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, the agency will continue to improve its knowledge, preparedness and response to Lassa fever outbreaks.
