A non-profit making organisation, Grassroots Empowerment and Justice (GEJ) Initiative, yesterday, hailed President Muhammadu Buhari, over the new guidelines issued by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) towards local government autonomy. The commendation was made by the national coordinator, GEJ Initiative, Ebriku John Friday, describing it as the best way to free local government councils from the shackles of state governors and underdevelopment. According to him, GEJ Initiative will support the NFIU to ensure that the guidelines are adhered to strictly for the grassroots people to have a sense of belonging in the democratic process. President Muhammadu Buhari, in 2018, signed the NFIU bill into law, thus separating the agency from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He said: “We, in Grassroots Empowerment and Justice, GEJ Initiative, received the news with gladness over the new guidelines by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit, (NFIU), to give financial autonomy to local government councils on cash withdrawals from the local government funds, hence, giving them powers to be autonomous in doing what is right for the grassroots people as part of good governance.  “This is why we commend and hail President Muhammadu Buhari over the signing of the NFIU bill into law enabling it to ensure that the local government councils are strengthened and start to play their strategic developmental roles in the democratic process in order for the grassroots people to directly enjoy democratic dividends.  Meanwhile, the group also called on state governors to conduct council polls for democracy to thrive at the grassroots level, which makes the people exercise their voting rights according to the electoral act, to elect their own representatives at the local government level in order to enjoy democratic dividends.
