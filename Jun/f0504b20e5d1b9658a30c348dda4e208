The Comptroller General, Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammad Babandede, has warned that passports reported lost or stolen if found, be returned for cancellation, as he warned that such are invalidated and can no longer be used for travel. To this effect, Babandede, in a statement by the Service Public Relations Officer (PRO), DCI Sunday James, has directed that all lost passports declared to the Nigeria Immigration Service, if found, be returned for cancellation as the continuous use contravenes section 10 subsection 1 (a) of the Immigration Act 2015. The statement states that: “A person who has, holds or is in unauthorised possession of more than one valid Standard Nigerian Passport, commits an offence and is liable on conviction, to imprisonment for a term of 10 years or a fine of N2million or both. The Comptroller General of Immigration, therefore, advised that such passports so declared, if found, “Must Not Be Used For Travel,” but submitted to the nearest Nigeria Immigration Service Office for cancellation. LEADERSHIP Weekend gathered that once a case of lost passport is reported to the Service, the complainant will have to apply for a new passport and this will require the completion of certain forms, which is to be submitted, along with other required documents, at a passport acceptance facility. Investigations further revealed that the case of lost or stolen passport is a very serious situation and the reality is that a lost or stolen passport, or the loss of one’s passport number, through a data breach, can mean more than the pain and expense of getting a new document. It can also lead to serious cases of identity theft. So, if one finds him or herself with a lost or stolen passport document, or stolen passport number, you want to be sure that you handle the situation appropriately and quickly.
