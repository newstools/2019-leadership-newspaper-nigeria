President Muhammadu Buhari has  felicitated with Rev Felix Meduoye, General Overseer (GO) of the Foursquare Gospel Church in Nigeria, on the occasion of his 70th birthday anniversary. The President in a statement by his media aide ,Femi Adesina recalled playing host to the General Overseer and leaders of the church at State House, Abuja, when the church turned 60 years in Nigeria, and wishes the cleric longer life as well as greater successes in the service of God and humanity. President Buhari equally thanked the Foursquare Gospel Church for fervent prayers for Nigeria at all times, particularly before the last general elections, which contributed largely to the positive outcome of the exercise. Noting also that the church sent him a congratulatory letter on his being reelected for second term in office, the President prayed that God will grant Rev Meduoye greater grace and favour, as family and friends rejoice with him at this fortuitous occasion.
