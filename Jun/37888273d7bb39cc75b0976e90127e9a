Gombe State Government on Monday said it has resolved to set up a special task force to address the present water scarcity in the state, particularly in Gombe the state capital. Governor Mohammadu Inuwa Yahaya, made this known while speaking with journalists in Gombe, shortly after inspecting facilities at the Dadin-Kowa Water Treatment Plant at Yamaltu-Deba Local Government area of the state. The governor in company of his Deputy, Manaseh Daniel Jatau and some of his newly appointed aides toured the plant, which currently supplies water to some few communities within Gombe metropolis. The governor said the plant has all the facilities to expand to treat 70 million litres of water per day but currently treating only 50 million litres due to lack of power as well as lack of some other machineries and is currently supplying inadequate water to some few areas in the state capital. He said the visit is in fulfilment of one of his major campaign promises of providing water to the people of Gombe. And also aimed at restoring the original production capacity of the treatment plant to 70 million litre per day for the supply of clean water to the growing population in the state capital and other neighbouring communities. Yahaya who vowed to end the current water scarcity in the state within some few months, said his government had discovered that the problem of Water scarcity in the state was multi-faceted and that one agency could not resolve the issue. He said it was in view of the challenges that he resolved to immediately set up a 7 man task force committee to work in collaboration with the state water agency to come up with probable solutions to curbing the challenges. “Any moment from now we shall announce the names of the Task Force members that would work with the state water agency to address the problem of water shortage in the state.”
