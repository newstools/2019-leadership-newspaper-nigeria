The deputy general manager of Ogun-Guangdong Free Trade Zone in Ogun state, Daniel Che, has stated that more investors have indicated interest to open up shop in the multibillion naira Free Trade Zone, as a result of the successes the Zone has recorded since its establishment in 2008 and the efforts of the management to create an investor friendly environment within the OGFTZ. Mr. Che made the revelation in Abuja while exchanging views with journalists on the expansion plans of the Zone. He noted that the world over, the concept of Free Zone has been embraced as a development model that enabled many Asian nations to attain development, “The concept of a Free Trade Zone has proved very germane in facilitating rapid industrialisation and deepening of foreign investment inflow into the country. It offers international and local investors enormous benefits in terms of the several regulatory and administrative incentives, which government has put in place for investment protection” He noted that since its creation in 2008, the Ogun-Guangdong Free Trade Zone remains one of the most successful FTZ in the country judging by the number of  foreign investors currently operating in the Zone “as we speak we have about 30 companies currently operating in the Zone, we have companies in ceramics, wood processing, iron and steel, household appliances, machineries and vehicle parts manufacturing and several others” Che said that products manufactured in the Zones are in high demand all over the sub-region and beyond because they meet international quality standard, while some are available within the country after appropriate taxes and duties have been paid to both the federal and state government. He noted that having successfully ran its operations in the last eight years the Zone is currently in the process of expanding its facilities to be able to accommodate the many foreign investors that have indicated interest in setting up shop in the Zone. “We are on track and are processing many applications, those to be admitted would be based on merit and this would be a gradual process and we have our programme carefully laid out.” He however noted that the immediate constraint the Zone was experiencing was the encroachment on part of its land as a result of the activities of land grabbers and some criminal elements within its area of operation. He used the occasion to appeal to those who are currently engaged in the illegal sale of potion of the Zones land to desist or be prepared to face the full weight of the law. “We have always enjoyed a cordial relationship with the Igbesa community, and that explains why we have embarked on a lot of corporate social responsibility projects which has enhanced the lives of members of the community, we see ourselves together with the community as partners, we are here for good, but when some people engage in provocative actions, by pulling down our perimeter fencing and engaging in the illegal act of selling parts of the Zones land to unsuspecting members of the public you would agree that this is setting the course for avoidable confrontation, these people should be advised to desist from their criminal activities or we will be left with no option but to visit the full weight of the law on them” he said.
