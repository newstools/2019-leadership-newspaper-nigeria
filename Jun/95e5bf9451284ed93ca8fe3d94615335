The Dean, Faculty of Environmental Science, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Nasarwa State, Prof Nasiru Idris, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to appoint only competent and qualified personnel as ministers and assignportfolios related to their area of specialisation. He said it was only by so doing that they can be relevant and be able to produce results beyond expectation of an average Nigerians. Professor Idris, an environmental specialist, made the remark in an open memo to the President titled “Towards a positive change in Nigeria.” Besides, he said President Buhari should not delay the appointment of ministers as was the case in first tenure, so that he can hit the ground running this time around. According to him, the president should consider decentralization of some federal ministries especially the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing which is key and critical sector of the economy, into three separate ministries. Professor Idris also noted that some federal ministries do not require ministers of states. He said Environment, Niger Delta and Solid Minerals amongst others should only have one minister while ministries like Internal Affairs, Education and Defense should have a minister of state in order to perform at optimal level and provide administrative leadership. Furthermore, he suggested that ministers should have equal rights and roles as they are representing their states as stipulated in the Nigerian constitution, therefore, avoiding conflicts between ministers of state and senior counterparts. The university don urged the President to revisit the report by Presidential Committee on reform of government agencies which recommended reduction of statutory agencies from 263 to 161 for reduction and burden on the cost of governance. He pointed out that the implementation of the report will restore the effectiveness and efficiency of parastatals in the delivery of services to the public.
