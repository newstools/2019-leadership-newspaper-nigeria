Contrary to the view that Nigeria’s reformatory/juvenile remand centres are not living up to expectation, 13 Borstal Training Institution Students of Abeokuta in Ogun State, have scored above the 160-benchmark set by the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB). The public relations officer, Borstal School, Abeokuta, Yusuf Raji, in a statement said, the students who performed exceptionally well, with the highest scoring 267; 11 scoring above 200 marks and the lowest scoring 188, also participated in the just concluded West African Examination Council (WAEC) exam and are expectant of favourable results in order to process their admission into various tertiary institutions in the country. The Controller of Prisons (CP) in charge of Abeokuta Borstal, Jemilehin, according to the statement, was delighted with the result and the performance of the students because it surpassed previous year’s performance. Represented by the head teacher in her office, the CP encouraged the students to be steadfast, describing their strides as a stepping stone in the right direction and tasked them to be resilient in their strive to be the best in their chosen field. Jemilehin applauded the staff, corps members, volunteer teachers and all those who contributed to the success recorded in the examination. Borstal institutions are juvenile remand centres that train and graduate thousands of young people. They offer education in a number of subjects including science and social science courses, with the students participating in the JSSCE, SSCE, JAMB and NECO examinations. Under the vocational programs, the school has tailoring/dress making, brick-laying/masonry, construction, electrical installation, welding and fabrication, carpentry, photography/video coverage, plumbing and pipe-fitting.
