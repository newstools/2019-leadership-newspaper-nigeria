The chairman, Nigeria Governors Forum and Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, and the richest man in Africa, Alhaji Aliko Dangote have commenced a frantic effort to reconcile the Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje and the Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammad Sanusi ll. There have been controversies leading to litigations following the creation of four additional emirates by the Ganduje administration in Kano State. LEADERSHIP Sunday reports that while the state government is investigating some financial transactions in the Kano emirate headed by Sanusi, the traditional council is also challenging the creation of the additional four emirates in court. The frosty relationship between Emir Sanusi and Governor Ganduje has attracted a lot of concern by many Nigerians, prompting Fayemi and Dangote to intervene. It was gathered that Fayemi and Dangote,  in their efforts to proffer solution to the impasse, arranged a meeting between Ganduje and Sanusi and the two leaders met briefly in Abuja on Friday. Contrary to earlier reports that Ganduje  had reconciled with Sanusi, the director of information to the governor, Yassar Aminu, said a brief meeting took place between the emir and the governor at the instance of Fayemi and Dangote in Abuja, but it did not end in a truce. “They did not reconciled. Fayemi and Dangote arranged a meeting between the governor and the emir. They met briefly in Abuja. The emirate council is still pursuing its case in the court while the state government is still carrying out the investigation into the emirate council. “But at the meeting, both of them promised to respect each other. If there is reconciliation, it means that the emirate council will drop the court case. Also, if there is a reconciliation, the government will suspend the investigation. But the emirates that were created still stand and the Kano Emirate Council is still pursuing its litigation. It is not true that they have reconciled,” Aminu told LEADERSHIP Sunday last night.
