The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) has stated that December 31, 2019 remains the deadline for any teacher not registered and licensed by the TRCN to be sent out of the classrooms. The Registrar of TRCN, Prof Josiah Ajiboye, who was speaking during a press briefing, yesterday, stated that by January 2020, the council would begin enforcement in all the schools in the nation. “It is not a matter of barking and not biting. By January 2020, we are going to begin enforcement. We don’t want to threaten anybody. But I think to be forewarned is to be forearmed. It is better to be in the side of the law. People should obey the directives of government and do that which is needful so that when the implementation starts, they won’t say they were not informed,” he said. Ajibode, who revealed that 80 per cent of those who had registered were from public schools, advised teachers in private schools to take advantage of another examination coming by October so as to become qualified, registered and licenced teachers. He noted that about 30,000 teachers have registered to write the first batch of the 2019 Teachers Professional Qualifying Examination (PQE) set for June, 7 and 8, 2019 in 50 Computer Based Test (CBT) Centres across the nation.” Ajibode revealed that the final draft of the review of the Professional Standard for Nigerian Teachers has been presented to the Council and will be distributed to all the registered teachers in the country so as to guide them in their conduct.
