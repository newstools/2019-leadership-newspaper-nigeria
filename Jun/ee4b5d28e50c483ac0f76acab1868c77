President Muhammadu Buhari has received with deep sadness, notification of the passing away of the president of Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN), Francis Johnson, yesterday. The president, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, joined PENGASSAN and all labour unions in the country in mourning the visionary leader, whose good nature, understanding and forthrightness helped in improving the welfare of workers, and contributed immensely to the stability witnessed in the oil sector. President Buhari affirmed that Johnson’s broadmindedness and generosity of spirit by always putting the nation first before all pecuniary gains shaped ease of relationship and smooth operations in the oil sector between employers and workers, recognising his wise and considerate positions in all negotiations. The president believes the labour leader’s demise is a collective loss to the family, labour movement and the entire nation, urging all loved ones to find solace in the legacy of sacrifice, diligence and patriotism he left behind, especially in speaking up for the voiceless and underprivileged. President Buhari prayed that the Almighty God would accept the soul of the departed, and comfort the family.
