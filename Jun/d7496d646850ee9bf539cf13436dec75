Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday assumed duty for a second term after subscribing to the relevant oath of office administered by the apex bank’s secretary and director, Corporate Secretariat Department, Mrs. Alice Karau. Before the expiration of Emefiele’s first term,  President Muhammadu Buhari had renewed his appointment for another five years, which the Senate subsequently confirmed. Emefiele, who was received into the bank by the four deputy governors, was elated by the turnout of the excited staff at the venue of the oath-taking ceremony chanting his name. In his remarks after ceremony, the apex bank governor expressed gratitude to God, President Buhari for re-nominating him, and the Senate for confirming his appointment. He also thanked the management and staff of the bank as well as the media for their support during his first term in office. While disclosing that he would unveil a new roadmap for the CBN and the economy after a series of consultations with critical stakeholders,  Emefiele charged all the stakeholders to strengthen efforts at building a healthy and stable system in Nigeria’s interest. In a press statement issued by the CBN yesterday in Abuja, the governor reiterated his resolve to make the CBN more people-focused, adding that the bank remained resolute in the belief that it must play an active role in supporting job and wealth creation in the country. Reviewing the various efforts taken by the bank to reduce weaknesses in the Nigerian financial system as well as support improved productivity of the economy, Emefiele said that more work still needed to be done to build a stronger economy for the benefit of all citizens of the country. According to him, the pace of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth remained fragile and below the rate of Nigeria’s annual population growth of 2.7 per cent. He, therefore, pledged that the Bank would continue to collaborate with the fiscal authorities to strengthen growth and wealth creation in the country. He said:  “We must strengthen our efforts over the coming years to stimulate growth and job creation in critical sectors of the economy, which will help insulate our economy from shocks in the global economy. “We must also work to build a healthy and stable financial system that contributes to the growth of our economy, while preserving price stability,” he added. Meanwhile, the CBN governor is expected to address a world press conference next week, where he will unfold a new roadmap for the CBN and the economy. CBN Injects $48.19 bn Into Forex Market In 15 Months Meanwhile, a total of $48.19 billion has been pumped into the foreign exchange market by the CBN in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 to support the naira which has remained stable at N360 to the dollar in spite of the declining oil price. The CBN has maintained its interventions at the Retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS), injecting dollars into the Wholesale, Small and Medium Enterprises, and Invisible segment of the market. Its foreign exchange sales have progressed as the foreign reserves of the country accrued. The reserves which had risen to $47.63billion in June last year from $40.56 billion in January 2018 had dropped to $41.99 billion in November before it began a slow accretion to $45.12 billion which it closed last month. Forex sales by the apex bank in the first quarter of 2018 at the rDAS/Interbank window, swaps, forwards and sales to bureau de change (BDCs) totalled $5.89 billion, while in the second quarter sales rose to $7.89 billion. It further rose to $11.88 billion and dropped to $10.72 billion in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively. The dollar supply in the first three months of 2019 stood at $11.81 billion. CBN’s foreign exchange supply to bureau de change operators between January 2018 and March 2019 totalled $12.04 billion, with the highest amount sold in the first quarter of 2019. According to data released by the CBN, the amount of forex supplied to BDCs rose from $1.35 billion in the first quarter of 2018 to $3.64 billion in the first three months of 2019. The apex bank sells $15,000 to each of the 4,500 BDC operators in the country on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for onward sales to customers in demand for personal and business travel allowance (PTA/BTA). Supply of forex to BDCs was highest in the first quarter of 2019 as the CBN sold $3.64 billion to the operators. Interbank dollar sales totalled $5.94 billion for the 15 months period with the highest intervention in the third quarter of 2018. In Q3 2018, the CBN had injected $2.16 billion at the interbank market compared to $1.8 billion in Q2 2018, $0.75 billion in Q4 2018, $0.68 billion in Q1 2018 and $0.55 billion in Q1, 2019. Swap sales in the 15-month period totalled $4.8 billion. Forward sales by the CBN between January 2018 and March 2019 totalled $15.46 billion with the highest amount of $3.47 billion sold in the second quarter of 2018. Although the CBN has maintained its stance of supporting the value of the naira with its forex interventions, analysts believe the declining price of crude oil may weaken the apex bank’s capacity to continue its interventions. The price of crude oil has so far declined by over 17 per cent selling at $62 per barrel as at yesterday. According to analyst at FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, a sharp decline in oil prices could threaten Nigeria’s economic recovery while disrupting exchange rate stability. “The potential decline in foreign exchange reserves from lower oil price is likely to weaken the naira consequently translating to rising inflationary pressures,” he said.
