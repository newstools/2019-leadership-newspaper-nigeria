Okorie represented by Ernest Nwafor, one of his legislative aides said the programme has been on since five years and would continue despite not going back to the National Assembly. “The essence of this training is to empower our constituents especially on various agricultural value chain development training. We are empowering them on poultry and piggery. “This programme has lasted for years. Though we are not going back to the National Assembly, we will still continue with the programme because it touches the lives of the people. So, it is a long time programme”, he said.
