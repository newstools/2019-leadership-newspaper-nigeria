The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, has assured lawmakers elected on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that they will head and be carried along in the formation of the lower chamber’s committees. Gbajiabiamila disclosed this to State House correspondents yesterday after a meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the presidential villa, Abuja. He said that the composition of the committees would be unfolded in the next few weeks, adding that “you will see how we intend to carry them along. I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag but you can be assured that they (PDP lawmakers) would be carried along.” Asked what Nigerians should expect to see differently from his leadership of the 9th Assembly, the speaker said: “Stay tune, you’ve heard my inaugural speech, we are going to do things differently, we are going to build on whatever were the achievements of the 8th Assembly, and it’s going to be a reformed house. “Like I have said, the reform will be done in piece meal so as not to shock the system. But they will be reforms that will be for the benefit of the country.  We expect the cooperation of all facets of government, including the executive and you – the journalists and our constituents,” Gbajiabiamila said. On his meeting with Osinbajo, the speaker said that it was official, adding that “any meeting with the vice president is relevant. It is about the economy and how to move the country forward, charting a roadmap about how to confront the problems that are facing Nigeria today. So these were the issues we discussed. “It wasn’t a personal meeting but you can call it a hybrid – between the personal and official but mostly it’s official. How the executive and the legislature can collaborate to make life better for Nigeria and Nigerians,” he said.
