A political party operating on the aegis of African Action Congress (AAC) has challenged Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State to account for the N8bn he collected from Federal Government as Paris Club Refunds in three months. A statement signed by AAC state party chairman, Mr Agba Jaliingo and issued in Calabar, yesterday, stated that Cross River State received over N8bn billion in three tranches from federal government as Paris club refunds. “Our party has confirmed that Cross River State received its share of Value Added Tax for the years 2015 – 2018 totaling NGN5.4 Billion, on Friday, May 31, 2019. “This brings the total amount to over N8bn, which accrued to the state between March and May 2019. The party’s statement reads, “As a registered political party, that is concerned about accountability and judicious application of public resources in Nigeria and Cross River state in particular, we demand that the State Governor, Senator Ben Ayade confirms to Cross Riverians and Nigerians, the amount he has collected as Paris club refunds”. The opposition party stated that it is worrisome, the way in which Governor Ayade has handled the Paris Refund since inception till now with almost no statistics and indices to to show to Cross Riverians as expected from an administration that floats the principle of “politics with ethics.” Efforts to get a government official to react to the opposition party’s challenge failed as there was no one to react to the accusation since Governor Ayade is yet to appoint a new chief press secretary after the governor’s inauguration since May 29.
