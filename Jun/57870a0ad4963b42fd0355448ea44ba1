The managing director and chief executive officer of the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), Umaru Ibrahim, has appealed to the 9th Senate of Nigeria to expedite action in the passage of the NDIC Act, 2006 (as amended) currently before the National Assembly. The NDIC Boss made the plea when the management of the Corporation paid a courtesy call on the newly elected president of the Senate, Dr Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan, in his office on Wednesday June 26th 2019. Responding, the senate president promised that the Senate would immediately commence work on the Bill to amend the NDIC Act 2006 afresh as the work earlier done by the 8th Senate had lapsed with the expiration of that Assembly. He noted the importance of the Bill and assured the management of the Corporation that the 9th Senate would give the bill the accelerated consideration it deserved. Earlier, in his opening remarks, the NDIC Managing Director congratulated the Senate President on his election, along with the returning and first time Senators on their victory at the polls. He stated the resolve of the Corporation to work closely with the Senate leadership and the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions to ensure a stable banking system, which is critical to the stability of the nationâ€™s financial system. The managing director/CEO concluded his remarks by reiterating the commitment of the Corporation to the sustenance of excellent relationship with the Senate, particularly the distinguished Senators, who would be on the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions adding that the cordial working relationship was not only crucial to the passage of the amendment of the NDIC, but other important Bills such as the Financial Ombudsman, which was intended to provide a quasi-judicial framework for resolving disputes between banks and their customers.
