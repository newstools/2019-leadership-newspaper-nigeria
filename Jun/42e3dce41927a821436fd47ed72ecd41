The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) felicitated with the Muslim Community as well as all Nigerians on the occasion of the Eid-el-Fitr. The party, in a statement, said the successful completion of the Ramadan points to the triumph of our collective faith in God over the vicissitudes of life, both as individuals and as a nation. The statement signed by PDP’s national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged Nigerians not to forget the eternal lessons of the Eid-el-Fitr, but to always bring them to bear in all aspects of life, particularly in their dealings with one another. “Nigerians, especially those in leadership positions, should use the occasion to rekindle the spirit of honesty, selflessness, care and love for others, so as to guarantee a united, stable and prosperous nation.” The party also beckoned on those behind various acts of violence and bloodletting in the nation to have a rethink, retrace their steps and join in the effort to rebuild the nation for the good of all. The PDP urged all compatriots to use the occasion to reach out and share with those that are hurting, particularly the sick, the deprived as well as victims of acts of violence in various parts of the country. The party wishes Nigerians happy Eid-el-Fitr celebrations.
