The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), has revoked five oil mining licences, OML, and one oil prospecting licence, OPL, belonging to five companies. In a public notice issued yesterday, the regulatory body said the revocation was based on a presidential directive to “recover legacy debts” owed by the companies operating the licences. The five companies affected are Pan Ocean Oil Corporation (OML 98); Allied Energy Resources Nigeria, (OML 120 and 121); Express Petroleum and Gas Company (OML 108); Cavendish Petroleum Nigeria (OML 110) and Summit Oil International (OPL 206). The revoked licenses are located in the onshore, shallow and deepwater areas of the Niger Delta basin. Pan Ocean is owned by Festus Fadeyi, billionaire businessman, while Allied Energy, which is now known as Erin Energy, has Kase Lawal, founder of Camac Energy, as its chairman. Express Petroleum, operators of OML 108, is technically managed by Shebah Exploration & Petroleum, a company owned by Bryant Orjiako, chairman of Seplat Petroleum Development Company, while Cavendish Petroleum has Mai Deribe as its chairman. Summit Oil International, operators of OPL 205, also known as the Otien field, was co-founded by the late MKO Abiola.
