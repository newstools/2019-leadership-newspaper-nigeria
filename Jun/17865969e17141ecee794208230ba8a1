A patron of Buhari Youth Organisation (BYO) and former publicity secretary of the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Godwin Erhahon, has cautioned leaders of the party in the state against escalating the internal crisis in the party by pitching former national chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, against the incumbent national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. In a statement he issued in Benin City, yesterday, titled “Internal Crises:  How not to fight family Battle”, Erhahon said Leaders of APC who have attempted feebly, to blame the raging crisis in the National Executive Committee (NEC) on the former national chairman, Chief John Oyegun, should beware, lest they complicate matters for the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who they are trying to defend. According to him, this is so because the attempt to drag Chief Oyegun out of his post-service quietude into strange controversy has provoked hatred and anger against the NEC and its leadership. “Coming at a time that Comrade Oshiomole from Edo North and Governor Godwin Obaseki, his estranged godson from Edo South are with daggers-drawn, pitching the Comrade against Chief Oyegun, who is foremost leader from Edo South, is counterproductive and therefore unwise.” He urged the leaders to, “bear in mind that however the raging battle is fought, APC will outlive the tension and acrimony of the moment.”
