Kano state government has cancelled the annual traditional Sallah event, Hawan Nassarawa, slated for today 6th June, 2019, after due consultations with all the relevant security agencies in the state. After a security meeting that was held between Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and the entire security agencies, concerning the proposed  Sallah celebrations, there was intelligence report that the event should be cancelled for the fear of breach of peace. It is clear to all that, Governor Ganduje is a peace loving leader, who doesn’t toy with safety and security of his people and all other citizens living in Kano. For this reason and as a result of the intelligence report, the state government is not relenting, and it declared Hawan Nassarawa cancelled. After the security meeting, the Kano Metropolitan Emirate Council was duly informed about the terrifying intelligence report and the cancellation of Hawan Nassarawa forthwith.
