No fewer than 30 persons were killed and 42 others wounded on Sunday evening when three Boko Haram suicide bombers attacked a viewing centre in Mandareri-Sambisa ward of Konduga local government area of Borno State. One Abdullahi Garba whose brother was killed in one of the attacks, said that the suicide bombers comprising two females and a male sneaked into the area around 9:15 pm on Sunday  and detonated the Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) strapped on them. Also, Usman Kachalla, director of Research and Operation of the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), said that the  suicide bombers detonated the IEDs in a local tea joint and a film centre in the community. Kachalla added that about 17 persons died instantly, bringing the death toll to 30 yesterday due to lack of immediate medical attention. He said: “Our staff could not reach the spot of the incident as the military had closed the road to traffic and the hospital in Konduga did not have enough facilities to handle the situation. When my team arrived in Konduga early this morning, the military prevented us from gaining access to the community to assist the victims. “They told us that they were given order from above not to open the road until 9am,”he said. When LEADERSHIP visited the State Specialist, relatives of victims of the attacks besieged the hospital in search of their loved ones.
