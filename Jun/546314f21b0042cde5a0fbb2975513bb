Having posted losses for five consecutive quarter, Lafarge Africa Plc returns back to profitability with profit after tax of N3.145 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The company’s first quarter ended March 31, 2019, released on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) showed that profit after tax rose by 104.17 per cent to N3.145 million from a loss position of N2.002 billion achieved in the corresponding period of 2018. Also, the company’s revenue stood at N78.512 billion from N80.643 billion in 2018, cost of sales went up by 3.69 per cent to N60.328 billion from N62.642 billion, resulting to a gross profit growth of 1.02 per cent to N18.18 billion as against N18 billion achieved in Q1, 2018. The company recorded a total asset of N591.2 billion, higher than N540.737 billion, resulting to an increase of 10.44 per cent, while shareholders fund went up by 67.26 per cent to N225.039 billion compared to N134.541 billion in Q1, 2018. Speaking on the results, CEO of Lafarge Africa, Michel Puchercos, said that Q1 2019 continued to show positive trends with the market up by six per cent. Despite a strong increase in January, market growth was affected by the delays in the context of February’s general elections. He added that Lafarge Africa’s cement volumes were up five per cent in Q1, impacted during the first week of January by our SAP Go-Live and in February by limited dispatch capacity. March sales were the highest of the last three years. He said that  “Our Strategy 2022 ‘Building for Growth’ in Nigeria is delivering the expected results with strong increase in operating EBITDA and profit. Our momentum is very positive and is expected to be sustained in 2019.” He stated that South Africa continued the turnaround plan with significant improvement in first quarter, 2019 compared to prior year, saying that “Our strategic decision to divest South Africa with a sale to another affiliate of the LafargeHolcim Group, will strengthen our balance sheet.” According to Puchercos, the rights issue together with the divestment of our South African Operations will deleverage Lafarge Africa by c.N246 billion, enabling to fully repay USD Shareholder Loan and short-term naira overdraft. “This will support Lafarge Africa’s ambition to accelerate the execution of its Strategy 2022 and to fully focus on the development of the Nigerian market.” On outlook, he point out that the market demand is expected to remain strong in second quarter of the year and the implementation of the company’s new strategy 2022 is expected to further improve operational and financial performance.
