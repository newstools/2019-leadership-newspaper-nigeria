A non-governmental organisation, Uzo-Uwani Professionals Association, has appealed to Enugu State governor, Hon Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, to return the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) to Adada community. The president of the group, Mr Jonathan Ezeh, who made the call during a press briefing in Abuja, on Monday, said this was in line with the multi-campus system recently passed into law by the State House of Assembly. According him, “It has become imperative to call the attention of the state government to the suitability of the Adada campus, following comments that the state government was undecided over the location of the Enugu North campus of the state university. “We understand that following the restoration of the multi campus structure of the university by the government, three schools viz: Faculties of Medical Sciences, Agriculture and Social Sciences have been returned to Enugu North Zone.” He added that we are also aware that the state government will take advantage of the 400 bed specialist hospital which is currently under construction in lgboano, to host the proposed College of Medicine. Recall that  Adada campus of Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) was closed fifteen years ago in a bid by the then government of Chimaroke Nnamani to centralize the university structure in his native Agbani in Nkanu local government of the state in negation of the act establishing the institution.
