A socio-political group under the aegis of The Renaissance Group has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for honouring the late chief MKO Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 12, 1993, presidential election. The group hailed the President for making June 12 the new Democracy Day and naming a national asset “the National Stadium” after him. Speaking during a press conference, in Abuja yesterday the convener, Arch Tunde Imolehin, said he demonstrated a rear exemplary leadership quality that exudes the spirit of unity that Nigeria long yearned for by choosing to honor the late sage without looking at the sentimental sectional barrier of South versus North divide. Imolehin also urged Nigerians to see the issue of tackling insecurity in the country as a collective responsibility of all. He also hailed “President Muhammadu Buhari led government has shown tremendous commitment in handling the situation.” Speaking further, Imolehin said since the issue of insecurity in the country has taken a new dimension there was need for the federal government to change its strategy in tackling the challenge. “There is need for us to put our heads together now that we have a new national assembly in place and build a secured nation for Nigeria. We should know that there is no nation if there is no security of live and property. “We want to appeal to Mr President not to tarry in putting together a very solid cabinet and hit the ground running. The President should ensure we have young vibrant, dynamic and energetic Nigerians in government while also satisfying the party’s interest,” he added.
