A group, under the auspices of National Democratic Front (NDF), has advised Nigerians against false reports about the Armed Forces of Nigeria saying such reports are capable of unnecessarily heating up the polity and causing disaffection within the military. NDF said recent reports about change of Service Chiefs in the country, which turned out to be false, should be avoided in order not to distract the military in the task of defending and securing the nation. In a statement signed by the group’s secretary general, Dr Bolaji Abdulkadir, the NDF said it is alarmed at the false reports about the Armed Forces of Nigeria in recent times, saying such development cannot be for the good of the nation’s democracy. The statement reads in part: “Our reference is specifically to the hoaxes making the rounds about the service chiefs having been changed, sacked or about to be replaced. “The first is that we observed that the stories are being published by outlets that have shown a track record of being sympathetic to the opposition or have fully aligned with the opposition in the past. “This, for us, is indication that the hoax is part of an elaborate plan that predated the general elections, which calls for concern knowing the extent of acrimony the opposition had displayed at that time,” the NDF stated”. The statement warned those behind the fake news about change in military leadership to desist from spreading falsehood irrespective of what motivates or incentivises them.
