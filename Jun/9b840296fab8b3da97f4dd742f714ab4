A good governance advocacy group within the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Rivers Unity House (RUH), has thrown its weight behind calls for the resignation of the APC National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Speaking to newsmen in Port Harcourt, yesterday, RUH Convener, Kingsley Wenenda Wali, said Oshiomhole was responsible for 96 per cent of the challenges that faced the ruling party in the 2019 general elections. Wali said: “It is a natural thing in politics that whenever there are losses, people have to be held accountable for those losses. There is need to identify the people who made it possible for the party to suffer any kind of loss. “Just like if the party enjoys a decent measure of victory, it will obviously point out those who made it possible and then, compensate them for making it possible. “So, those who are responsible for the body-blows APC received should be identified and made accountable so that this kind of attitude can be discouraged. “I am one person who has been consistent with the position that Mr Adams Oshiomhole is 96 per cent responsible for the problems APC had. It boils down to nothing but somebody feeling that he knows everything and no other person is smarter than him. “I think the reasonable thing to do is for APC, as a party, to ask Adams Oshiomole to vacate the seat. If we insist on understanding or characterising the next level slogan of APC, the kind of attitude that Adams Oshiomhole exhibited cannot be in tandem with the president’s vision for Nigeria.”
