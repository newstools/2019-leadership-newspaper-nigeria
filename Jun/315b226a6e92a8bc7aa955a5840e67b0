The Accountant General of the Federation, Alhaji Idris Ahmed yesterday in Kano allayed fears that servicing the country’s debt at the rate of 70 per cent of the total national income would destabilize the economy. Ahmed, who spoke when he paid traditional homage on the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, yesterday at his palace insisted  that  the debt servicing currently being settled would  not cause the nation any problem since the federal government has initiated some strategies to cushion the effect of the debt profile. According to him, “We are doing our best to meet our obligations even though debt services are obligations and we meet them as at when due. We do not have any problem in offsetting our debts. “It is always a burden paying debts and anyone paying debt would know that he is just meeting a burden which has to be made in line with the agreements both some local and international debts, but we just have to abide by all our agreements and obligations”. Speaking on the 30 per cent revenue generation to meet the nation’s expenditure, Ahmed explained that, “There are a number of ways the federal government is deploying measures to boost its revenue generation drive.” He said critical among the measures rolled out by the government include “ the strategic revenue growth initiative under which all the revenue generating ministries, parastatals are given portfolios to meet revenue targets.” He noted that “All these agencies are given the responsibilities to generate and they are working assiduously to meet up their revenue portfolios. So all these efforts are part of the strategic measures, among other efforts, the federal government is putting in place as strategic plan to boost the revenue generation of the nation.”
