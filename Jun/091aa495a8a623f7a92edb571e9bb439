The advert further requested applicants to forward their documents in PDF format to ikebethe99@gmail.com with N2,000 fee for “parcel charge” and N500 for “institution form” which are to be paid into Ike Bethel Chinemerem account, with United Bank for Africa account number 2084734943. He said while effort are ongoing to track and apprehend the syndicate, members of the general public should note that the advert page is fake and a scam meant to dupe unsuspecting members of the public. He restated that the Nigerian Army does not charge applicants money for application forms, recruitment or appointments into the service. “Members of the public are therefore enjoined and encouraged to report any person or group parading as agent of  the so called “Eparcel Service for Military Hospitals” processing fake recruitment on behalf of the Nigerian Army Medical Corps. He further advised members of the public to be suspicious of dubious offers of employment especially through the social media and  report such offers or person(s) to the nearest Army location or the Nigeria Police Force for necessary action.
