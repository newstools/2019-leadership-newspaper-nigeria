National chairman of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has read what seemed as a riot act to the governor of Bauchi State over his refusal to inaugurate members-elect of APC, saying such act is capable of distorting the peace in the state.  He further stated that the APC did not use state institutions like police, against the inauguration of Senator Bala Mohammed as governor, “It is a shame to use federal institutions against the inauguration of state assembly,” in Bauchi by the governor.  The national chairman also described as shameful, the scenario, which played out in the state assembly of his home state of Edo, adding that he could not even speak about it. Speaking yesterday night at the national secretariat when he received the state House of Assembly members-elect, who had come to formally inform the party national leadership on the development in Bauchi, Oshiomhole said, “If the governor insists then he is inviting trouble. “If we didn’t misuse federal might and institutions in preventing Bala Mohammed from being inaugurated, it is a shame to use federal institutions against the inauguration of state Assembly,” APC national chairman stated.
