Capital market analysts expressed optimism that the Nigerian stocks market will experience a rebound in the third quarter of 2019, urging investors to take advantage of low equities pricing. Prof. Uche Uwaleke of Nasarawa State University, Keffi, speaking recently at the Capital Market Correspondents Association of Nigeria quarterly forum, said that investors embrace the stock market by taking advantage of the prevailing low price of equities in order to partake in the opportunities of market reversal that would commence by end of second quarter. Uwaleke, now a research fellow at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said “unfolding internal and external factors such as swearing of President Muhammadu Buhari for second term and early constitution of his cabinet would impact the equities positively”. He said, “The Nigerian market which ranked as the world’s third most rewarding market in 2017, ranking only after Turkey and Argentina, and became bearish subsequently, is poised to enter into another bullish era by third quarter.” He said that lowering Monetary Policy Rate by the Monetary Policy Committee, increase in minimum wage, and increase in oil price and continued stability in Foreign Exchange would impact on the market” Uwaleke added that continued moderation in inflation, steady growth in Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product early signing of 2019 budget and implementation, improved growth in non-oil sector among others, would affect the market positively.
