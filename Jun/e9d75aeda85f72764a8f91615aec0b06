The former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, yesterday, has described the judiciary in the country as the Daniel that has always come to Judgement and also described Justice Abang as not only a model but also one of the exemplary ambassadors of the Judiciary in Nigeria. He made the statement following his victory at a Federal High Court in Abuja over his Certificate of Return as the Senator-elect for Imo West Senatorial District, presided over by Justice Okon Abang. Justice Abang had, in the case between Okorocha and INEC, over the seizure of his Certificate of Return by the electoral umpire, ruled that the Commission has no right under any known law in the country to withhold the Certificate of Return of a candidate that has been announced and returned as winner of an election by the Returning Officer. The governor, in a statement through his media aide, Sam Onwuemeodo, said whatever happened concerning his Certificate of Return was in the plan of God so that the nationâ€™s democracy can further be strengthened and rights of the citizenry also protected considering the pronouncement of the Court over the seizure of his Certificate of Return. In the spirit of his victory in Court, the former governor said that he had equally forgiven the Returning Officer in the Imo West Senatorial election, Prof Innocent Ibeabuchi whom he said, falsely claimed that he declared him winner under duress and all those who had played one role or the other to cause the ordeal he went through, over his Certificate of Return. The former governor, in all, dedicated the victory in Court to the people of Imo West Senatorial District in particular and Imo people in general for their unflinching support and steadfastness, and assured that he would continue to play politics without malice or bitterness.
