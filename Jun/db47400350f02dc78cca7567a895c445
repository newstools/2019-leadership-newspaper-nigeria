Justice Hussain Baba-Yusuf of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory has convicted Apostle Basil Princewill, Founder and General Overseer of Mountain Mover Fire Ministry of International, Nyanya, Abuja for raping a 14-year old girl, name withheld. In his judgement yesterday, the court convicted Apostle Princewill on counts one and three, while the “randy” pastor was discharged on counts two and four. The court held that ”it is bad for a person to indulge in this kind of devilish act. ”Those who are supposed to be men of God are expected to be highly religious, exhibit decency and act as role models to their followers. “Considering the interest of the girl, the interest of the public and the rising cases of rape in the Church by those who serve in the Lord’s vineyard, the court has duty to send signal to the public to serve as deterrent to others. Justice Baba Yusuf said the behaviour of the pastor was ”despicable, shameful, degrading and satanic”. ”By this conduct, the accused deserves to be taken to prison wall like a monastery until he changes to a better man of God. “It is more worrisome, especially when a person in question is looked up to as a man of God. Consequently, the court sentenced Apostle Princewill to 7 years imprisonment for raping and defiling a 14 year girl (Favour) and 5 years sentence for attempting to abort the resultant pregnancy. Count one bordered on rape while count three was on allegation of attempting to cause miscarriage on the girl, by giving her drugs to take in order to abort the resultant pregnancy. The incident took place on July 27, 2011 to 31st December 2011. Apostle Princewill was arraigned by an amended charge on September 22, 2017.
