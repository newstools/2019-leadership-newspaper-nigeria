The shareholders of Julius Berger Plc have approved the payment of the total sum of N2.64 billion as final dividend from the 2018 financial year profit of the company. This was as the shareholders expressed appreciation during the group’s 49th Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Abuja on Thursday, commending management of the quoted company for bestriding the company into a profitable year-ended 2018, at a time the construction industry recorded low performance. The N2.64 billion represents N2.00 per 50 Kobo share, held in the equity of the company. The dividend would be subjected to withholding tax at the appropriate rate at the time of payment. The financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2018, released yesterday showed that Julius Berger Group recorded gross revenue of N194.617billion in 2018, against the N141.890billion revenue in the previous year. The group’s Profit – Before- Tax (PBT) rose from N3.739 billion in 2017 to N10.197billion in the 2018 financial year, while its PBT also recorded significant growth to N6.630,667 in the year under review. That is higher than the N1.158billion posted in 2017. In real terms, profit attributable to equity holders of the parent company rose to N6.992billion, against the N4.716billion generated in 2017, with earnings per share standing at 5.30 for the 2018 ended year. Meanwhile, the company’s receivables arising from rendering of services stood at N5.568 billion. However, the group’s total financial assets stood at N194.18 billion for the year under review. While its liabilities also climbed to N84.85billion. Thanking the shareholders for their commitment and trust, the firm’s chairman, Mutiu Sunmonu, said Julius Berger Services Nigeria Ltd saw a tremendous positive improvement, with a 75 per cent increase in port operations considering the number of vessels serviced. “This demonstrates that Julius Berger Services Nigeria Ltd.’s services and operational capacities are competitive and of compelling value to clients. The company’s domestic and international design and engineering subsidiaries, PrimeTech Design and Engineering Nigeria Ltd. and Julius Berger International GmbH, steadily worked towards expanding their portfolios to capture a greater portion of third-party clients in their respective markets,” Sunmonu announced. Sunmonu said the company’s strategy on building loyalty and repeat business with its customers was proving effective and has provided the foundation for the launch of a second AFP showroom location, in Lagos, in addition to the flagship location in Abuja.
