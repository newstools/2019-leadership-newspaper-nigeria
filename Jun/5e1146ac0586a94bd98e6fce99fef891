The Office of the Head of Service of the Federation (OHCSF) on Monday commenced verification for federal civil workers in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) in Enugu State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the verification holds simultaneously in the Southwest, Southeast and South-South geo-political zones from June 17 – June 28. Mr Umaru Lawal, the Deputy Director in the office told NAN that the essence of the verification was to capture the information and documents of every civil servant in the MDA’s under the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) Human Resource (HR) module. He said that the verification would help eliminate ghost workers and ensure financial prudence and accountability in the payment of salaries to the Federal workers/ civil servants. Lawal further said that the office would stop the salary of anyone who was not captured during the exercise. Some of the workers being verified expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the exercise. Mrs Ngozi Agu and Mrs Eunice Ibekwe of the Federal Ministry Works, Housing and Power said the exercise was going on smoothly and orderly.
