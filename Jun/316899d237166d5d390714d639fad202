Oil prices resumed their slide yesterday, dragged down by a surprise gain in U.S. inventories and comments from the head of Russian state oil producer Rosneft questioning the point of a deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), to withhold supplies. Brent futures were down 27 cents, or 0.4 per cent at $61.70 a barrel. They rose 1.1 per cent on Tuesday after a near 13 per cent fall in the previous four sessions. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down by 32 cents, or 0.6 per cent, at $53.16 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark closed 0.4 per cent higher on Tuesday. Oil prices have fallen sharply on fears about slowing global demand, but won a respite on Tuesday after a global stock market rally on hopes of a cut in U.S. interest rates. U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories built more than expected, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday. Crude inventories rose by 3.5 million barrels in the week to May 31 to 478 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 849,000 barrels. Official numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) are due out later on Wednesday. “It was a very bearish number and if confirmed by the EIA it will hammer prices,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management in Bangkok. been weighed down by concerns about slowing global growth from the U.S.-Sino trade war and President Donald Trump’s threats last week to place tariffs on Mexican imports. To prevent oversupply and prop up the market, the OPEC, together with allies including Russia, has been withholding production since the start of the year. The group plans to decide later this month or in early July whether to continue the supply curbs.
