The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has graduated another batch of 26 Ab-initio student pilots as part of its efforts to boost capacity of its personnel for enhanced professional performance in protecting the nation. A statement by the director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, said the graduation ceremony, which took place on June 20th 2019 at 401 Flying Training School (401 FTS), Kaduna saw 16 student pilots graduating on the Diamond 40 aircraft and 10 on the Super Mushshak aircraft types, four of which were female officers. In his address, the chief of air staff (CAS), Air Marshal SadiqueÂ  Abubakar, who was represented by the Commandant, Air Traffic Services Training Centre, Air Vice Marshal Haruna Mohammed, recalled how flying training in the NAF plummeted to its lowest ebb in the 90s owing to myriad of challenges ranging from unavailability of training platforms to logistics support related issues. Air Marshal Abubakar, however, revealed that from mid-2006 to date, successive NAF administrations had endeavoured to rejuvenate flying training in the NAF. He said the desire to build adequate capacity in the NAF had materialised into the production of an unprecedented number of pilots, with 92 new pilots winged in the last four years. He further disclosed that since the inception of the current NAF leadership, the NAF had acquired 10 brand new Super Mushshak aircraft and upgraded facilities at 401 FTS to boost ab-initio flying training.  He, therefore, urged the graduands to sustain the attitude of rugged determination that carried them through ab-initio training to the next phase of their flying training whilst continuing to work hard to reach the zenith of their careers.
