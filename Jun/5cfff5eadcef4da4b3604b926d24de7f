The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), has listed critical factors that are crucial to drive economic diversification in the Nigerian economy. Director-general of LCCI, Muda Yusuf in a release to LEADERSHIP said that the quality of infrastructure, the quality of policies and the quality of institutions is crucial to get these key parameters right, saying that it was equally critical to ensure proper alignment among these key variables to ensure sustainable economic diversification. According to Yusuf, the policy factor has many dimensions, monetary policy, forex policy, interest rate policy, tax policy, trade policy, procurement policy and investment policy.  Each of these policies has a major role to play in the economic diversification process. The policy mix must be right for the desired outcomes to be achieved. “The monetary policy for instance should be designed to drive domestic investment through a moderation of the monetary tightening stance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  This is needed to moderate interest rate in the economy.  It is difficult to drive domestic investment at current levels of interest rate which is well over 25 per cent for most economic players.  The economy needs investment, especially domestic direct investment to drive diversification.retary-General, Antonio Guterres, has accepted to co-chair a multi-billion fund-raising  session to revive the Lake Chad – a strategic effort that has major climate, economic, agricultural and employment implications for the region following Nigeria’s request to the African Development Bank.
