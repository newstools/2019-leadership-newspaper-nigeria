Senator representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the senate, Senator Philip Aduda, has donated 72 motorcycles and six truckloads of fertilizers to rural farmers through the 72 ward coordinators in the six area councils of the territory. Distributing the items to the beneficiaries in Bwari at the weekend, Aduda, explained that the gesture was aimed at assisting and encouraging rural farmers in the FCT, and also for their support during the last national assembly election. Represented by a House of Representatives member, representing AMAC/Bwari federal constituency, Micah Jiba, the senator stated that his desire to give more priority to farmers is because farming has always been a major occupation for people living in the FCT. He noted that since 2003, when he was elected into the national assembly, he has always ensured that all rural farmers across the six area of the FCT are given fertilizer in order to have a bumper harvest. Aduda therefore cautioned the beneficial farmers not to allow middle men convince them to sell the fertilizer to them, adding that they should endeavour to apply them in their farms. Receiving the fertilizers on behalf of the farmers, the Sarkin Noma of Bwari, Ibrahim Adamu, commended the senator for always identifying with the farmers in every farming season. Adamu said that the fertilizer would boost bumper harvest next year, just as he assured the senator of their support at all time, adding, “And we shall put in place a committee that will ensure that every farmer gets this fertilizer, and we will also ensure that the product are not diverted. “
