In this report, BODE GBADEBO presents a list of prominent traditional rulers in the country who were top brass in the military, police or para-military organisations before they were either poached from active service or from retirement in order to become traditional leaders of their people.

Alake of Egbaland High Royal Majesty, Oba Michael Adedotun Gbadebo’s emergence as the Alake of Egbaland in August 2005 ended a six-month period of uncertainty about who would succeed the former Alake, Oba Oyebade Lipede, who died on February 3, 2005.
