Former Zamfara State governor, Abdulaziz Yari Abubakar, has left behind a whopping sum of N251billion as inherited liability to the current administration. The figure represents a colossal increase from the N49billion inherited by his administration in 2011 from his predecessor, Alhaji Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi. Giving the breakdown of the liability the chairman transition committee, who is also the former deputy governor of the state, Alhaji Ibrahim Wakkala disclosed that liabilities from economic, environment, general and social services stand at the sum of N151.1billion approximately. He also disclosed that from the Ministry of Finance, outstanding loans, contract retentions, bailouts and loans from banks reflect a sum of N65.3 billion approximately. Furthermore, he said liabilities from the Ministry for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs stands at a sum of N33.3billion approximately. The committee chairman revealed also that a sum of N1.4billion was discovered as liability from unremitted National Housing Fund, and pension contributions deducted from salaries between 2016-2019. Liabilities from education sector and pension and gratuity matters reflect N2.8billion and N1.6billion respectively. Mallam Wakkala however assured the public that the committee was not set up to witch hunt or blackmail anybody, but saddled with the responsibility of discovering where things went wrong with a view to sanitizing the governance process. In a swift reaction, Yari’s media aide, Ibrahim Dosara described the allegation as baseless and unfounded, saying that “It is just an attempt to smear the good name of the former governor.”
