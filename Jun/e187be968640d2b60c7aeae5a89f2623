The director-general of the Debt Management Office (DMO) has said the federal government does not have plans to approach the Eurobond market to raise funds this year after its last outing in November of last year as the Central Bank of Nigeria plans to issue N809.3 billion in Treasury Bills in the third quarter of the year. DMO chief, Patience Oniha speaking at an Islamic finance conference in Lagos yesterday said Nigeria has no plans to return to the Eurobond market this year, after it raised $2.86 billion last year. Nigeria approved a three-year plan in 2016 to borrow more from abroad. The federal government had planned to cut down on its local borrowings whilst making 40 percent of its loans to come from offshore sources to lower borrowing costs and help to fund its budgets. Oniha while answering a question on whether the government would consider a U.S. dollar- denominated Eurobond, said, “For 2019, given the process, I would say no.” She said foreign borrowing for the 2019 budget is set at N802 billion or $2.7 billion. Nigeria, which emerged from recession last year, has borrowed abroad and at home over the past three years to help finance its budgets and to fund infrastructure projects, but debt servicing cost is also rising. The government has said it wanted to tap concessionary long-term loans to finance its 2019 budget in addition to borrowing at home.  It sold $3 billion in Eurobonds in 2017, part of which it used to fund its budget that year. It then followed with a $2.5 billion Eurobond sale last year to refinance local currency bonds at lower cost Meanwhile, the CBN is set to mop up N809.3 billion in the third quarter of the year from the 91 day, 182 day and 364 day treasury bills maturing while the same amount would also be reissued in the same quarter of the year.
