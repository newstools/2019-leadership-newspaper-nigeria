Chairman, Agreement Renegotiation Committee of Nigerian Universities, Dr Wale Babalakin (SAN), yesterday, said Nigeria must restructure its university and secondary school education system to turn out employable graduates and regain respect of world community. This, he said, becomes imperative because of the present ranking of Nigeria’s best university as 800th in the world. Delivering the seventh convocation lecture of the Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete Babalakin said that the nation must start its education system all over again. Babalakin, who emphasised the need for both state and federal governments to channel adequate funding into secondary and university education system, said that quality products from secondary school system would ensure good and quality university graduates. He posited that Nigeria requires an average of N1.1 million to train each undergraduate in its universities annually. He also lamented present situation whereby, expatriates are being employed instead of Nigerian graduates while global organisations like Cadbury etc were no longer managed by Nigerians unlike in the past due to perceived low quality of graduates. “There’s hope but we have to start afresh. We must have an educational system that’s globally competitive”. It’s not sufficient to fund a university; it should be properly funded. The world is not waiting for us. The world will start to respect us if we make our universities world class. Even when we say there’s no money, I believe that with ingenious application, the money will become available”, he said. Also speaking,the Vice Chancellor of KWASU, Professor AbdulRasheed Na’Allah, said that the major challenge of the institution is funding, disclosing that, “For five years now, the university has not received subvention from government, not towards salary, not towards overhead, not towards nothing!”
