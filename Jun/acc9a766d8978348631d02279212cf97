An attempt by Oando Plc and some of it directors to join the suit filed by the embattled Group Chief Executive Officer of Oando Plc, Wale Tinubu challenging his sack, was yesterday opposed to by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A lawyer, Yele Delano (SAN), who appeared for the oil company at the continue hearing of the case before Justice Ayotunde Faji of the Federal High Court in Lagos, said he had been briefed by Oando to seek to join the case. Delano urged the court to allow his client to join the case as an interested party because any decision reached by the court would affect their interest. But SEC, through its lawyer, Chief Anthony Idigbe raised opposition to the request for joinder, on the grounds that it would predetermine the respondentâ€™s case. Tinubu, and his Deputy, Omamofe Boyo had filed the suit seeking enforce their Fundamental Rights to fair hearing and to reverse their sack. Already Justice Mojisola Olatoregun had granted an order stopping SEC from imposing a fine on Tinubu and carrying out its decision to remove him and his deputy, Omamofe Boyo from being directors of public companies for five years.
