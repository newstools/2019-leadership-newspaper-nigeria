The House of Representatives ad-hoc on media has informed that no party has taken position on the zoning of principal officers. The ad-hoc committee stated this yesterday in Abuja while briefing newsmen on the activities of the House ahead of its resumption. A member of the committee, Hon Yusuf Gagdi explained that the issue of principal officers of the House is not the responsibility of one party adding that while some of the positions are provided for minority parties, both the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition parties are yet to sit down to decide where the offices should be zoned to. “This moment, I don’t think we’ve received any communication from Mr. Speaker or leadership of any political party regarding the position of officers of the National Assembly,” he said. Earlier the chairperson of the ad-hoc committee on media, Hon. Khadija Abba Ibrahim reiterated plans for the proposed reforms expected of the 9th House of Representatives as pledged by Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila. Ibrahim also disclosed that the speaker would in the coming days, visit Zamfara and Borno states to examine constituency projects.
