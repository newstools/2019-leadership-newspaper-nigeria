On his part, Programs Manager,Zoe’s Flower The Foundation, Duru Rafael, stressed that it is important to promote awareness on sickle cell and basic understanding of sickle cell, as statistics have shown high number of sickle cell births in Nigeria due to lack of awareness, he noted that this information is key and that is why its important for  public to know the need for know their genotype before marriage. A warrior, Nwachukwu James Obi,30, described life with sickle cell as difficult, adding that it involves selecting activities, as a child and going in out of hospital, and even taking medication daily. He disclosed that he has been sacked from three jobs and is currently jobless due to his sickness. Obi explained that Knowing his limits and avoiding strenuous activities that can give rise to crisis is his way of managing the disease “I was always in and out of hospital as a child   requiring blood transfusion getting older crisis requiring admission reduced to 4 in a year by 28, and 2 now that i am 30.When it’s too hot or too cold it can lead to a crisis preferable to stay in room temperature” he said.
