Nigeria’s power generation capacity is now over 7,500 kilowatts (KW) as transmission increases to 7,000kw, the minister of power, Engr Sale Mamman, has said. The minister, who was speaking at the commissioning ceremony of a 47.5kw solar energy system at Doka Rural Hospital, Kachia local government area, Kaduna State, said the improvement recorded was a function of the enabling policies of the federal government such as the Rural Electrification Strategy and Implementation Plan;  Mini-grid Regulations;  Sustainable Energy for All (SEforAll) among others. “I will not fail to inform this gathering that our grid power generation today is over 7, 500MW, the transmission capacity has also improved to 7, 000MW,” he said. He said distribution remains the weak link within the system and is receiving the desired attention at optimising its operations for all to benefit. Commending the Kaduna State government for its support and cooperation in the partnership that led to the Doka project being commissioned, as well as the  European Union to Nigeria and ECOWAS for partnering with the state, the minister called on the community to protect the investment and support the hospital management. Kaduna State deputy governor, Dr Hadiza Balarabe, who represented Governor Nasir El-Rufai, said the state was committed to preserving and boosting public trust in health facilities across the state. In her introductory remarks in the “Kaduna Solar for Health” handbook shared at the event, Bararabe said, “With the additional grant of 10 million Euros from the European Union delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS and the state government’s commitment of $8 million, Kaduna Solar for Health would be extended to all state-owned rural and isolated general hospitals as well as an additional 221 primary health centres (PHCs) across the state. This will bring the total solar capacity to 3.69MW.”
