The World Bank Group yesterday launched its first Nigeria Digital Economy Diagnostic Report during an eNigeria 2019 hosted by the government. The report reveals that although Nigeria is the largest mobile market in Sub-Saharan Africa with a strong mobile broadband infrastructure and a vibrant digital entrepreneurial ecosystem, the lack of infrastructure and connectivity in the country’s rural areas is a key challenge. The government’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan for 2017–2020 (ERGP) recognises the need for a digital-led strategy to make its economy more competitive for the 21st century.  In line with this goal, the Digital Economy Diagnostic revealed that the country has made several positive developments in the digital space including high-speed Internet via five underwater international links. This has significantly reduced constraints in terms of international bandwidth usage and prices, as well as boosting network capacity. Additionally, the bank said Nigeria is improving on the provision of digital platforms. The government created a central portal to improve the delivery and quality of public services. With the size of Nigeria’s economy, the report highlighted the enormous opportunities Digital Financial Services (DFS), a driver of financial inclusion, could have for this growing market. The financial sector has already benefited from investments in payment systems and financial markets infrastructure, such as the Bank Verification Number (BVN). Millions of Nigerians still lack formal identification records to access a range of public and private services. Financial inclusion in the country has effectively stalled with around 60 million Nigerian adults without access to a formal account.
