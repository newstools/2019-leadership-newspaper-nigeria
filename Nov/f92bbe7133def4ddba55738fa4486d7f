Few weeks after its suspension, Med-View Airline has concluded arrangements to resume flight operations this week. In preparation to that, the airline recently received one of its aircraft, a Boeing 737-500 with the registration number: 5N-BQM which arrived the Murtala Muhammed Airport Two (MMA2), Lagos from Abuja Airport via the Kaduna International Airport. It was gathered that the airline’s aircraft’s engine was last week replaced in Abuja by a company in Tokyo. The aircraft, which departed Kaduna International Airport, touched down at the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos at 5pm on Sunday. With the arrival of the new engine and subsequent fixing, it was gathered that the airline would resume flight operations this week. It would be recalled that Mr. Michael Ajigbotoso, chief operating officer , Med-View Airline had about two weeks ago reiterated the plans of the airline to return to flight services in the next few weeks. Ajigbotoso had few weeks ago told newsmen that the airline, which remains the only carrier on the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) had temporarily suspended operations due to lack of equipment, but assured that the management had perfected plans to return to some of its old routes in the country. He also declared that the airline was in compliance with the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) 9.1.1.12 (A), stressing that the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) was aware of its current status.
