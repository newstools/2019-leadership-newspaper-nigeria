Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund) has spent N435,149,999.08 for the promotion and support of impactful research activities and staff development at the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU). The Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof Francis Otunta stated this at its 9th convocation ceremony at the campus, near Umuahia, the Abia state capital, adding that the fund was spent from 2018 till date. He said the beneficiaries include 52 staff who have attended conferences and workshops, 15 for Ph.D training programmes, and 25 for basic research projects both within the country and abroad. He said since he took over the mantle of leadership of the 27 year-old University in March 2016, it has remained on a steady course in the pursuit of its core mandate and having positive impact on the host community. Otunta maintained that besides the renovation of some of the dilapidated infrastructure his administration met on ground, it has embarked on the construction of new ones and procurement of some critical equipment.   According to the VC, who said out of the 7, 028 graduands, 6,214 obtained first degrees with 100 scoring first class. He said, “This administration is not limited by the success recorded so far, but is determined to follow the trajectory of sustainable development that will illuminate the image of the University in global light of university ranking. According to him, evidence of such focused leadership was reflected in the ranking of 121universities in the country based on the level of staff participation in the six review exercises by the National Universities Commission (NUC). The VC, who explained that the review was conducted between 2 January and 7 March this year, added that the University was placed 9th. “This is an improvement from the 57th it occupied in the earlier exercise of 2015/2016.”
