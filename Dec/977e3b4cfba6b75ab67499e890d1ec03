No fewer than 33 people have died following the outbreak of cholera in various communities in Andoni local government area of Rivers State. Also, no fewer than 100 persons have been hospitalised as a result of the outbreak in Unyeada, Ngo, Afaradigi, Samanga and Oyorokoto communities in the local government area. Chairman of the Ngo Town Community Development Committee, Clement Sunday, who disclosed this to newsmen in Port Harcourt, said his community alone has lost over 10 persons. Sunday said the number of death was increasing by the day as one person dies every six to 12 hours due to alleged inadequate health officials to manage the over 100 persons already diagnosed with the bacteria disease in the local government for the past one week. He said he was keeping tabs and monitoring the situation, and called for urgent deployment of more health officials to help handle the situation. The CDC chairman, who attributed the cholera outbreak to lack of potable water in the area, said the people depend solely on rain water now because their streams and wells were drying up due to the harmattan. Meanwhile, the permanent secretary, Rivers State Ministry of Health, Mrs. Caroline Wali, has confirmed the cholera outbreak in communities in Andoni local government area. Wali was however silent on the number of deaths recorded so far and the cause of the outbreak. She urged the people of the area to maintain good hygiene, wash their hands always and drink clean water.
