The Cross Rivers State civil servants have raised the alarm over the neglect of pensioners and non-payment of retiree’s gratuity by the State governor, Ben Ayade since assumption of office in 2015. A Director in Cross River State Civil Service, speaking on condition of anonymity made this known in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Abuja. He said that if the federal government is ready to fight corruption, Governor Ben Ayade should be given an ultimatum to commence the payment of gratuities and pension arrears to pensioners. He added that the Association of Pensioners in the state and other stakeholders are afraid of talking because the governor is good at sanctioning anyone who brings up the issue. Lamenting the situation, the source said that “those of us in the service is as helpless as those who have already retired, we have the feeling that if those who retired in 2014 has not been paid and if we are retired in 2019 when will they pay us when they have not paid those who retired since 2014?” According to the source, the state governor received bailout funds and Paris Club Refund to pay salaries and pensions but the governor only paid 2013 arrears. “We heard that the Federal Government released the funds for the primary purpose of clearing all outstanding salaries, pensions and gratuities; but the government is yet to pay. “We still have those who retired in 2013 that have not been paid, so we have complete backlog from 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and many have retired. “The past administration was setting aside N50 million each month to pay pensioners’ gratuity but this governor has completely stopped the payment,” said the source
