The minister of Power, Engr Sale Mamman yesterday directed the immediate suspension of the managing director of the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Plc (NBET), Marilyn Amobi and the managing director, Rural Electrification Agency (REA), Damilola Ogunbiyi over respective allegations of infractions leveled against them. In separate statements by the ministry’s spokesman, Aaron Artimas, which were also posted on the ministry’s Twitter handle, the minister said the actions were in furtherance of the ongoing sanitisation and re-organisation in the ministry. For the NBET, the statement read: “In view of this, the minister has also directed the constitution of a 5-man investigative committee to look into the myriads of complaints against the MD/CEO of NBET with the view of restoring sanity in the management of the company. “Consequently, she is to handover to the most senior director in the organisation.” On the REA boss, the statement said the suspension followed some apparent infractions in the agency which prompted the indefinite suspension. Ogunbiyi is also to hand over to the next most senior officer in the agency.  The minister also directed an immediate investigation into the activities of the REA over time. Artimas said that the decision was a continuation of the reorganisation/sanitisation in the Ministry of Power. He said that the minister directed that the decision should take effect immediately. “‘In view of this, the minister has also directed the constitution of a five-man investigative committee to look into the myriads of complaints against the MD/CEO,” the statement said, adding, “This is with the view to restoring sanity in the management of the company. Consequently, she is to handover to the most senior director in the organisation.”
