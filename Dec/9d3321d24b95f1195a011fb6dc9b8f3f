Health, accident and emergency response professionals in Nigeria have lauded TraumaCare International Foundation (TCIF) for taking proactive steps to save thousands of traumatised persons in the country. The foundation recently held a trauma conference in Lagos with the theme “Trauma Care: The Way Forward” where stakeholders from private and public sectors across the country brainstormed on how to improve services to victims. Majority of the speakers at the event demanded increased government and private sector investments in facilities that will ease the plight of trauma victims. They also called for more trauma care education and awareness in the country. Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire lauded the organisers of the event saying it came at a time the Federal Government was taking steps to curb the scourge of trauma on citizens. Represented by Dr. Mustapha Alimi, medical director of the National Orthopaedic Hospital Igbobi Lagos (NOHIL), the Minister said trauma was the leading cause of death in individuals under 45 years of age worldwide, accounting for about five million deaths annually. Some of the identified  factors marring efforts to tackle trauma as mainly out-of-pocket treatment of victims,  insurgency in the Northeast, communal conflicts,  rising crime wave in all parts of the country,  small arms proliferation, which have caused  weapon-wounded-related injuries and deaths to many. Available statistics indicates that Nigeria records about four million injuries and more than 200,000 deaths annually from road crashes, which is a major cause of traumatic injuries. A participant, Christian Ikpa told journalists that thousands of Nigerians die annually not knowing where and how to get help in times of trauma.
