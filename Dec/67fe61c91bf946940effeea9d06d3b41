Air Peace, has bagged the Corporate Award of Excellence at the 2019 edition of the University of Ibadan (UI) Alumni Association Luncheon and Awards held recently at the International Conference Centre, University of Ibadan. Delivering a lecture titled “Nigeria and the Rise and Rise of Ethnic Nationalism’, chairman, Air Peace, Barr Allen Onyema explained that our bane as a nation is our inability to live beyond the prisms of ethnicity. Onyema noted that Nigeria’s multi-ethnicity is supposed to be a strength but it has become an albatross. The UI alumnus, who bemoaned how Nigerians whip up ethnic sentiments in salient national discourses, remarked that “we must make a resolve to start harnessing the powers that lie in our ethnic composition and leverage them for the development of the country.” He urged his fellow alumni to toe the same path by giving back to the University and the larger society, adding that “as part of giving back to the University and the city of Ibadan which shaped him, Air Peace would commence flights into Ibadan from Kano, Owerri and Abuja”. Onyema noted that “Very soon, we shall start flying Abuja-Ibadan-Abuja daily, Kano-Ibadan-Kano and Owerri-Ibadan-Owerri three times a week. This is part of our no-city-left-behind initiative and our plan to interconnect various cities of Nigeria, giving our esteemed customers more seamless connections.” It will be recalled that just last month, the airline announced the commencement of Kano-Owerri-Kano flights.
