A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, has condemned the alleged attack on the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, by some Nigerians in Madrid, Spain. Amaechi, who is former Governor of Rivers State, had in a message he posted on his official Twitter handle, alleged he was attacked while attending a climate change programme in the Spanish capital. The message reads: “Some minutes ago, I was attacked by a few misguided Nigerians while on national assignment at a climate change event in Madrid, Spain. They were quickly repelled by the Spanish police before they could do any harm. I am fine. I was not hurt. Thanks for your support and prayers.” But reacting to the incident in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, the APC chieftain, Eze, described the attack as an act of ingratitude by enemies of Nigeria against one of the shining lights of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. He noted that Amaechi, whose record-breaking activities in the Ministry of Transportation had become a positive reference point for those assessing the Buhari administration, both internationally and locally. The APC chieftain stated that said attacking the Minister was a violent violation of everything good about Nigeria’s march to development. Eze said: “Patriotic Nigerians, who are in touch with the progressive strides of this administration, especially the bold moves currently being made by Amaechi will never applaud the attack on the Minister. “I read about the sad report of the attack by some misguided Nigerians on one of the Nigerians’ finest leaders, Rt. Hon. Dr. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi the incumbent Minister of the Ministry of Transportation who was on official duties in faraway Spain.”
