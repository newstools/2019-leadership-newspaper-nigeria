In the first nine months of this year,, the federal government spent the sum of N462 billion on fuel subsidy, which in its parlance is known as under-recovery. The figure was contained in the “Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Monthly Financial and Operations Report” for September 2019. It showed that the government spent about N462.10 billion as under-recovery (subsidy) from January to September 2019 to ensure that Nigerians buy Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) or petrol at the pump price of N145 per litre. An analysis of the NNPC Report showed that for September 2019, the amount incurred as  subsidy in the nine-month period was 51.51 per cent or N157.101 billion higher than the N305 billion budgeted for subsidy by the federal government for the whole of 2019. The amount the NNPC spent on subsidy, on behalf of the government, for the nine-month period was 96.74 per cent of the N477.67 billion transferred by the corporation to the Federation Account during the period under review. The amount the NNPC spent on subsidy, on behalf of the government, for the nine-month period was 96.74 per cent of the N477.67 billion transferred by the NNPC to the Federation Account in the period under review. A breakdown of the subsidy indicated that in January, February, March and April, May and June 2019, N40.53 billion, N2.876 billion, N13.34 billion, N104.35 billion, N102.34 billion and N30.64 billion was recorded as under-recovery respectively. In addition, N93.7 billion, N42.93 billion, and N31.41 billion were incurred as subsidy in July, August, and September 2019 respectively. In comparison, the NNPC’s remittances to the Federation Account stood at N54.17 billion, N38.0 billion, N59.58 billion, N36.08 billion, N31.43 billion, N70.58 billion, N61.5 billion, N51.79 billion and N74.54 billion,  in January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, and September 2019 respectively. The under-recovery was incurred by the NNPC on behalf of the federal government. Under-recovery is a situation where the NNPC bears the cost of the differential between the official pump price of petrol and the actual cost of the commodity, especially now that the official price is lower than the actual market price. The difference in this current system of subsidy payment is the fact that since the NNPC is the sole importer of PMS into the country, it is making the payments to itself or deducting the amount as cost from its revenue, and not paying it to other oil marketers as was the case in past subsidy regime. On its financial performance for the month ended September 30, 2019, the NNPC announced a trading surplus of N8.59 billion, rising by 65.2 per cent compared to N5.20 billion surplus it posted in August 2019. According to the NNPC, the significant increase of 65.2 per cent in September was due largely to the improved surplus posted by both the upstream and downstream subsidiaries of the NNPC: Integrated Data Services Limited (IDSL), Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) Nigerian Gas Marketing Company (NGMC), Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Nigerian Pipelines and Storage Company (NPSC), and Duke Oil Incorporated. Also, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) has said that the government spends N21.22 per litre of petrol as under recovery. In a statement issued in Abuja, yesterday, by the PPPRA executive secretary, Abdulkadir Saidu he said that data from the international market showed that gasoline sells at an average price of $582.80 per metric tonne. When added to the landing cost and the Expected Open Market Price (EOMP), the price averaged N146.85/litre and N166.22/litre for NNPC’s imports only. Saidu explained that due to the cost of financing component built into other marketers’ imports, the landing cost and EOMP, the price of PMS price averages N149.86/litre and N169.23/litre. He added that the weekly data covering 28th November, 2019 to 4th December, 2019 showed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) official exchange rate averaged N306.97/$ and the parallel market rate was stable and averaged N360/$ during the period. The PPPRA boss said that the reference freight rate from North West Europe (UK-Coast – UKC) to West African Frontier (WAF) averaged $30.87 per metric tonne, the rate decreased when compared to previous week’s average of $35.45 per metric tonne. Saidu maintained that the total petrol receipt for the period (28th Nov – 4th Dec 2019) was 473,602 million litres, Automotive Gas Oil (AGO) 68,366 million, Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) 20,327 million litres. The average daily discharges of PMS for the week stood at 67.66 million litres. The data indicated that the national truck-out volume of petrol for the week was 409.22 million litres, AGO 115.97 million litres, and ATK 27.05 million litres. Household Kerosene (HHK) recorded zero. The average daily truck-out volume of PMS for the week from various depots for supply to retail outlets was 58.46 million litres while the average days sufficiency for PMS and AGO during the week were 47.25 and 41.29 days respectively.
