Youths for the  Fatherland, a non-political youth pressure group has warned the federal government that  the Ahiajoku  Lecture series, revived and sponsored  by the Imo state government, is a smokescreen  to provide a  platform for intellectual vent to the  agitation for Biafra. The group thereby urged government direct the security agencies to take more than a passing interest in the lecture programme Youths for the  Fatherland made the allegation in a press statement in issued in Port Harcourt on Sunday. The statement noted that the group  investigated the motives behind the hasty revival of the lecture series by the state government before  coming to the conclusion, adding  that the government gave its agenda away when it announced that they were expanding the catchment area of the lecture to include the South-East and South-south zones or the old eastern region. According to the statement signed by the president of the youth organisation, Commrade  Chibuike Otega, “The ambitious Imo state governor is hiding under Ahiajoku Lecture series to provide an intellectual platform to galvanize a road map for the actualisation of biafra. This is why they have expanded the scope of the area covered by the lecture to the old Eastern Region. While they pretend to be promoting Igbo culture at the lecture they are using its platform to  secretly discuss how to reunite the old Eastern region  for the actualisation of the biafran dream.” Otega said his organisation came to this conclusion based on the reports filed by their members who were sent as spies to monitor both the preparation of the lecture series and its execution According to him the reports were conclusive that the state governor of Imo state, Emeka Ihedioha, is hiding under the lecture series to engineer a reunification of the old Eastern region so as to strengthen the base for the biafra project The youth leader said that it is  this ambition that explains why the governor was in a hurry to revive the lecture series which has been moribund for eight years and why he created a parastatal  known as Ahiajoku Lecture Institute  and appointed  Dr. Amanze Obi, a well-known  biafra irredentist , as its director  general “Our  investigation reveals that this so called Ahiajoku Institute will be the intellectual under cover for sanitizing and mobilising leaders from the former eastern region to negotiate unity in the old region in the believe that with one voice biafra can be achieved,” the statement added The statement said the next phase of the agenda is to begin to organize common projects for the region such as  sports and cultural programmes Otega urged the federal government and security agencies to immediately investigate their claims because they will find out that there is more to the Ahiajoku Lecture series than meets the eye. According to  him, one of the calculations of the Imo State government in coming up with the strategy is that they  believe that with the PDP controlling majority of the state governments in the old eastern region forging a united front for political gains is much easier
