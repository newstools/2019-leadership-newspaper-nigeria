President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the present administration will continue to expend huge amount of money on the Nigeria Police in order for it to accomplish its statutory function of maintaining security of lives and property. He said the police remain a critical pillar of the security architecture, which his administration will continue to fund. The president stated this yesterday in Kano while delivering an address at the passing out ceremony of the 2nd Regular Course of the Police Academy, Wudil Kano State where 628 cadets were commissioned as ASPs. He also said that the cardinal agenda of this administration is centred on the enhancement of security, improvement of economy as well as fight against corruption. He said, “Let me remind you of this administration’s agenda and our promise to the people to provide security, ensure improvement of the economy and the fight against corruption. As we remain committed to deliver on this mandate the Nigeria police force remains the critical pillar of our domestic security agenda, so it is therefore important to have orderly, disciplined and modern police officers.” “The mission of this academy is to produce superior police officers that are equipped with knowledge and skills to police Nigeria with its unique complexities,” the president stated. The president while congratulating the graduands for successfully completing their course also reminded them of the need to be diligent and uphold the principles of civil policies leveraging on national and international best practices. “I, therefore, seize this opportunity to congratulate the cadets of the 2nd regular course for successfully passing through the rigorous academic and professional training,” he added.
