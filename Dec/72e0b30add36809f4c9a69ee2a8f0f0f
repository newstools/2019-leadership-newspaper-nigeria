Managing Director of Jaiz Bank Plc, Mr Hassan Usman says the bank trains Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) operators on digital marketing to boost their businesses and increase their earnings. He spoke with journalists at the digital marketing training, SparkUp Business, organised by the bank for MSMEs owners in Abuja on Thursday. He said it was important that businessmen and women always updated their knowledge of business. The advent of smartphones and internet has actually changed the ways businesses are conducted and Nigerian entrepreneurs need to go with the trend, he said. “Things are changing business and we need to constantly update our knowledge of current trends in business. “Digital marketing is a world of its own and we need to know this and improve our knowledge. “We have to get prepared and seize the numerous opportunities in digital marketing. “We have to be proactive and take our businesses beyond the physical; we should take it to the digital world and get connected to the whole world via the internet. “This is why we organised this training today for our customers who are into MSMEs, to boost their businesses and improve their earnings. “This is a way of saying Jaiz Bank is with the MSMEs in their journey to success; in their journey to grow their business and become big entrepreneurs,” the Jaiz boss stated.
