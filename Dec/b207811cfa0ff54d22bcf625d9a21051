The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) said the Authority was investigating a sign post at Lagos airport , saying the Authority has placed a ban on the usage of Uber, Bolt and others at the airport. The alleged ban on the transportation systems was earlier reported in an online platform. In a swift reaction, the aviation agency, through its image maker, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, reacted to the reports that went viral online, urging passengers to use any means of transportation of their choice within the airport. In an official statement issued yesterday and made available to LEADERSHIP, FAAN stated, “We will like to state with all emphasis that passengers and the general public are free to use whatever means or mode convenient to transport themselves to the Lagos and other airports in Nigeria. “We will therefore like to use this medium to inform the general public that the said sign post did not emanate from FAAN and our security personnel have been instructed to remove the signpost and investigate the issue,” the statement said.
