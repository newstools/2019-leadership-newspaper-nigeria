A Civil Society Organisation (CSO) known as the Shammies Unusual Hearts Foundation, has donated food items to the less privileged as part of the Christmas and the new year charity. Speaking during the donation in Abuja, the executive director of Shamies Foundation, Mrs Saratu Abdul, said that the aim was to reach out to less privileges, widows and single parents in the society who canâ€™t afford to provide for their family members this Christmas season. Some of the items distributed to the widows include bags of rice, cooking oil, frozen chicken and toiletries. Abdul further said that if she has things bothering her and if she has any problems in her life, that she will go out and give whatever she has to people and before she knows it, she will feel lighter. She noted that the foundation was established with the mission to rehabilitate, empower and reintegrate ex-convicts into the society through a wide range of advocacy, representation, trainings and support programmes. The women who were full of excitement, commended the Shamies foundation team and the executive director for having such a large heart on this season.
