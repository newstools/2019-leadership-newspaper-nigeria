Unity Bank and Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc have partnered on Bancassurance to create a robust financial solution that provides customers access to insurance services while carrying out their banking transactions. Veritas Kapital is expected to leverage on the customer base of the bank and its distribution channels to sell its products. Veritas Kapital representatives would be present in designated flagship branches under the initiative to rollout Bancassurance products which offer financial protection covering wide ranging policy and risks in areas such as Motor, House Owner, Personal Accident and House Holder insurance policies. Speaking at the media unveiling of the initiative at Unity Bank’s head office in Victoria Island, Lagos, yesterday, the managing director/CEO, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs Tomi Somefun, believes that the bank’s long standing relationship with Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc makes the implementation of the agreement work best for all parties, particularly, the bank’s customers. She added that the new synergy would bolster the bank’s agribusiness and its value chain as customers in livestock and crop production can be effectively offered an insurance cover. Similarly, managing director/CEO, Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc, Mr Kenneth Edore Egbaran, is confident that this partnership would open new vistas of opportunities to offer even more innovative financial solutions to customers to enable them access numerous benefits that are available through insurance products.    Since 1984, Veritas Kapital Assurance Plc has been offering non-life insurance products and services to individuals and institutions across the country. This expertise, combined with Unity Bank’s strength in agribusiness and the offering of Veritas Kapital in agricultural products such as Area Yield Index-Based Insurance, Livestock Insurance, Property and Produce Insurance, would provide a unique solution to enhance the customer’s experience.
