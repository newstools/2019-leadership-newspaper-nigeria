From budget performance, unemployment, GDP movement and oil prices influence on the domestic economy to public debt increase, MARK ITSIBOR takes a look at the issues that dominated the Nigerian economy in 2019 The Nigerian economy in 2019 witnessed a mix grill of weak growth and muted development. From an averaged 1.9 per cent growth rate in 2018, the economic growth remained stable at 2 per cent in the first half of 2019. Domestic demand remains constrained by stagnating private consumption in the context of increased headline inflation 11.85 per cent (year-on-year) as at November 2019. As rightly noted by the World Bank in Nigeria, on the production side, growth in 2019 was primarily driven by services, particularly telecoms. Agricultural growth remains below potential due to continued insurgency in the Northeast and ongoing farmer-herdsmen conflicts. Industrial performance is mixed. Oil GDP growth is stable, while manufacturing production slowed down in 2019 due to a weaker power sector performance. Food and drink output increased, likely in response to import restrictions. Construction continues to perform positively, supported by ongoing megaprojects, higher public investment in the first half of the year, and import restrictions. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product grew by 2.28 per cent (year-on-year), in real terms, in the third quarter of 2019, compared to the third quarter of 2018, which recorded a growth of 1.81 per cent, compared with 2.12 and 1.81 per cent in the preceding and corresponding quarters, respectively. The oil sector is still contributing less than 10 per cent to the GDP. Non-oil sector remains a major component of the GDP led by agriculture and manufacturing. In real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 90.23 per cent to the nation’s GDP in Q3 2019. The delay by parliament in approving the 2019 budget affected implementation and increased fiscal uncertainty by pushing the bulk of spending to the second half of the year. As at the last count, minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed said the sum of N650 billion has so far been released for capital projects in the 2019 budget. There was a target of releasing additional N250 billion to bring the total release to N900 billion by December before President Buhari signed the 2020 appropriation Bill into law. Nigeria’s debt stock increased by 3.11 per cent from $81.27 billion in the first quarter of 2019 to $83.88 billion or N25.70 trillion as at the end of June 2019, according to official figures. Despite the increase, Nigeria remained at moderate risk of debt distress.  The Federal Government recorded improved revenue collection through the major revenue generating agencies – FIRS, Customs and NNPC in 2019. According to reports, government revenues in Nigeria increased to N1,026.95 trillion in the third quarter of 2019 from N944.58 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Domestic economic developments showed that in the year under review, there was improved growth driven largely by the performance of the oil sector, which grew by 6.49 per cent, while the non-oil sector grew by 1.85 per cent. The Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMI) also expanded for the 31st and 30th consecutive months at 58.2 index points, apiece, in October 2019. Staff projections indicate that real GDP in Q4 2019 is expected to grow by 2.38 per cent, driven by the non-oil sector. Headwinds to this projection, include: continued high level of unemployment, mild resurgence of anticipated inflationary pressures towards the December festive season, rising public debt, high level of insecurity, and slow pace of oil price recovery. Despite these headwinds, growth is expected to pick on the back of recent actions by the CBN to boost credit to the private sector through the recent Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) and Global Standing Instruction (GSI) initiatives, sustained interventions by the Bank in selected employment and growth-enhancing sectors, as well as fiscal policy measures to support growth. The Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria at its last meeting for the year in November predicted that the seasonal end-of-the year uptick in prices of consumer goods; accentuated by the border closure, would temporarily trigger food supply shock, which it said will adjust over the medium-to-long term as the economy increase investments in food production. Consequently, food inflation rose from 13.51 to 14.09 per cent in September and October 2019, respectively. The Nigerian land borders were closed to address the incidence of increased cross-border banditry, smuggling and dumping, insurgency and the illegal trade practices of neighbouring countries whose economies had become dependent on Nigeria through smuggling through the borders. In the monetary side, there was a record broad money supply (M3) which grew by 5.72 per cent (year-to-date) in October 2019, compared with the 2019 indicative benchmark of 16.08 per cent. Growth in Net Domestic Credit (NDC) moderated to 26.38 per cent in October 2019 from 30.33 per cent in the previous month. This was attributed to a significant reduction in credit to Government in October 2019 to 85.99 per cent from 114.79 per cent in the previous month. Growth in credit to the private sector, however, improved to 13.08 per cent in October 2019 from 12.49 per cent in the previous month, reflecting the impact of the Bank’s recent policy on loan-to-deposit ratio. An increase in absolute gross credit, amounting to N1,169.70 billion, was recorded between end-May and end-October 2019. Consequently, the manufacturing sector received N459.69 billion, the highest in two decades. This was followed by consumer loans of N356.65 billion, General Commerce (N142.98 billion), Information and Communications (N82.07 billion), Construction (N74.52 billion), Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (N73.20 billion), Mining and Quarrying (N3.64 billion) and Transportation and Storage (N3.09 billion), amongst others. The Committee, therefore, urged the management of the Bank to sustain its current efforts to improve lending to the private sector and to explore other initiatives to provide funding to other critical sectors of the Nigerian economy. In the review period, money market interest rates reflected the prevailing liquidity conditions in the banking system. Overall, the monthly weighted average Inter-bank call and Open Buy Back (OBB) rates fell to 7.87 and 7.22 per cent, respectively, in October 2019, from 11.41 and 10.73 per cent, respectively, in September 2019, the MPC said at its last meeting. The Committee noted that the persisting bearish trend in the equities market, had started to abate in November 2019, and was pleased by the increased patronage in the sovereign bonds market. The All-Share Index (ASI) grew by 2.41 per cent to 26,991.42 index points on November 22, 2019, from 26,355.35 index points at end-October 2019. Market Capitalisation (MC) also grew by 1.54 per cent to N13.03 trillion on November 22, 2019, from N12.83 trillion at end-October 2018, due largely to portfolio shift from short-term Government securities to the equities market.    There is improved resilience of the banking system, as the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) ratio declined further to 6.56 per cent at end-October 2019 from 6.67 per cent at end-September 2019 and from 14.05 per cent in October 2018. The Committee, however, noted that this figure remained above the prudential benchmark of 5.0 per cent, and urged the Bank to sustain its current efforts, which have created this exorable prudential regime.   Overall, the medium-term outlook for the domestic and global economies continue to be clouded with uncertainties, associated with the persisting trade wars between the US and its major trading partners, financial vulnerabilities, rising levels of public and corporate debts, pockets of geopolitical tensions and weakening global output. However, the reforms underway in the domestic economy; aimed at diversification away from oil over the last three years have provided adequate shock absorber to withstand the headwinds. The Committee further urged the fiscal authorities to invest massively in public works programme and improve fiscal buffers to complement these efforts. Forecasts of key macroeconomic variables, however, indicate prospects of improved output growth for the economy. Based on recent revised projections, the economy is expected to grow in 2019 by 2.3 per cent (IMF estimate), 2.1 per cent by the World Bank, and 2.20 per cent by the CBN. The Committee noted the tailwinds to these developments, to include: sustained stable exchange rate; enhanced flow of credit from the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to the private sector; expected improvements in tax revenue and efficiency in public expenditure; continued improvement in the business environment and activities; and the sustained interventions by the Bank in the real sector.
