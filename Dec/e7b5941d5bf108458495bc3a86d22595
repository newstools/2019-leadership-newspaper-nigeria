Senator Kabir Garba Marafa’s younger brother, Alhaji Sambo   Marafa has explained why he resigned as the special adviser to Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara State, saying that there was no rift between them. In a statement he issued to journalists in Abuja yesterday, Sambo said that he resigned to enable him concentrate on his private businesses and most importantly, to pave way for other persons from among  their teeming supporters to be considered for appointments. Sambo, a member and principal officer in the Zamfara State House of Assembly between 1999 and 2003, said that the cordial relationship between his senior brother and the governor spanning decades is intact and flourishing for the benefit of the state. “Governor Bello has been a senior brother to me because he is a very close friend of my elder brother”. The struggle we made that saw us to Supreme Court  was not done to put PDP in government, it was done to defend our collective rights and that of our people. My gratitude therefore goes to Allah (SWT) then to Governor Bello for finding me suitable to be appointed as his Special Adviser out of over four million people in Zamfara State,” he said. Stating his reason, Hon Sambo said; “Looking back at the journey from our party congresses to rancorous party primaries and the long journey through the state high court,  appeal court and finally the Supreme court and the massive support my brother got from the length and breath of our state and even beyond, I reasoned, it would amount to extreme selfishness to put myself first before so many prominent members of my brother’s political camp, especially those that were either imprisoned, sacked, or wickedly sidelined/redeployed, all because of the  struggle to emancipate our state.
