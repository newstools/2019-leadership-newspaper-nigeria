In the new week, analysts at Cowry Asset Management Limited expected “The NSE ASI to rebound amid sustained lower single digit rates in the fixed income space, especially T-bills, which would be less attractive to investors. “Also, investors maintained a bullish position on the last trading day for the just concluded week, so we expect this positive direction to be sustained in the new week.”      Cordros Securities noted that “We see the level of activity and volatility being sustained over the final days of the year, with some pockets of gains expected, as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020.”
