Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited say they expect Inflation to hover around 12.05 per cent in December, as festive induced demand, coupled with the impact of the border closure to have a negative pass through on food inflation. “Despite continued foreign exchange stability and liquidity, we expect core inflation to increase further, given the low base from the corresponding period in the prior year. Overall, we expect headline inflation to sustain its upward trajectory, expanding to 12.05 per cent in December.”
