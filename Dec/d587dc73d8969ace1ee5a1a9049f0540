The Pro-tem chairperson of the Nigerian Youth Workers Association (NYWA), Sir Ben Duntoye, has reiterated that the NYWA is set to kick-start laudable projects with positive impact in nation building. He made this known during the stakeholders’ consultative meeting held recently in Abuja. Duntoye said, “It is gladdening to note that our efforts put together for almost a year is gradually coming to fruition. I commend everyone who has contributed one way or the other towards the achievement of this event. I appreciate your commitment towards the flagship of a professional body for youth work practitioners in Nigeria. “When new ideas like this come up, it is not always easy to accomplish. Of course there will be bottle necks and challenges. It is therefore our commitment and determination that will make us excel. “We wish to appreciate the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports for the support and encouragement. The history of NYWA cannot be written without references to the contributions of the Honourable Minister, Mr Sunday Dare and the Permanent Secretary, Mr Olusade Adesola.”
