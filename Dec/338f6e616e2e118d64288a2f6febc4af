The minister of women affairs and social development, Dame Pauline Tallen has urged Nigerian parents to give their children sex education at an early age, adding that kids should not be left in the care of house helps without adequate measures to check what happens in their absence. Tallen stated this yesterday during a thanksgiving service as part of activities to mark the year’s 16 days activism against Gender Base Violence at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church, Maitama Abuja. She said parents must teach their children about the sacredness of their body and also encourage them to speak out when anyone touches any sacred part of their body. She also said the ministry is working on a legislation to castrate anyone convicted for rape and there is a political commitment on the part of Mr. president since he is very worried over the high prevalence of rape cases and violence against women and children. “By the grace of God we are working on the legislation and it will come to pass. That is the only way we will stem the tide of this inhumanity against women and children,” she said. According to the minister, “We are therefore advocating to parents to educate their children about the sacredness of their body and not to allow anyone touch any part of their body or to speak out when anyone touch any sacred part of their body. We should not be ashamed of calling and teaching them the different parts of the body. “We should promote and ensure that our children remain virgins until they get married and at a very matured age. We condemn early marriage. We condemn children not going to school. We advocate that the girl child must remain in school until minimum of senior secondary education. We even pray that parents should allow their children finish their university education before marriage. That is what we are advocating.”
