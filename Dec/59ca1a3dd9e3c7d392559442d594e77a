Bagos, in a statement personally signed by him,  urged the government to intensify efforts towards ensuring their release. “I  call for immediate action to be taken by the federal government to facilitate the release of these great Plateau citizens who were abducted in the North East. “I am deeply saddened by this situation where Plateau citizens are being abducted, and the recent is that of a Medical Aide worker with Alliance for International Medical Action Miss Jennifer Ukambong Samuel. “As a lawmaker I am disturbed that innocent Plateau citizens have been abducted by Boko Haram in Borno State. I plead for the immediate release of these innocent citizens of Plateau State who are mostly youths  with professional callings, and have dedicated themselves working in the  North East to provide humanitarian help to victims of insurgency,” he stated. “It is very unfortunate that  Ukambong, who is an orphan, was kidnapped along with several others in a brutal ambush along Monguno-Maiduguri road on Sunday, 22nd December, 2019, the day she was marking the 21st remembrance of her dear father’s demise. “I want to join other spirited individuals to condemn this act of inhumanity. I also pray that the federal government, through the various security agencies, will take immediate action to ensure the safe release of our innocent Sister,” the statement added.
