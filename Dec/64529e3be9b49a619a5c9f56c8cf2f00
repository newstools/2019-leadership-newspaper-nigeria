Chairman/CEO, Nigerian in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri Erewa, has condemned in strong terms the attack on the minister for Transport, Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, while on tour of climate change summit in Madrid, Spain. The minister had through his twitter handle announced a physical attack on him by some people he described as “misguided Nigerians.” The transport minister said he was on a climate change summit in Spain when some violent Nigerians charged at him. He said the attackers were summarily restrained by the police in Madrid, leaving him unscathed. According to Amaechi on his Twitter handle on Friday: “Some minutes ago, I was attacked by a few misguided Nigerians while on national assignment at a climate change event in Madrid, Spain.  They were quickly repelled by the Spanish police before they could do any harm. I am fine. I was not hurt. Thanks for your support & prayers.” However, Erewa in a statement she personally signed and a copy made available to LEADERSHIP, condemned the attack in strong terms. Dabiri, therefore, cautioned Nigerians living abroad to desist from acts capable of denting the country’s image abroad. “We appeal to Nigerians to be of good behaviour wherever they find themselves because such incidents ultimately tarnish the image of the country within the host country, with multiplier negative effects on Nigerians living in that country, who are law abiding and well behaved,” she noted.
