The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu is set to appoint five female police officers to the rank of Commissioners of Police. The IGP, who stated this at the 2019 Nigeria Police Force Women’s conference in Abuja yesterday, said five female officers would soon be elevated to the rank of Commissioner of Police as part of a deliberate effort to place more women in managerial positions. He noted that more women would be appointed into top management positions in the Nigeria Police Force, as female police officers have demonstrated intelligence and capability and had shown that they could compete favourably with their male counterparts in critical engagements. According to him,  “We have produced several women police officers who have and are still holding strategic positions as Commissioners of Police, Assistant Inspector General of Police and Deputy Inspector General of Police. Very soon, more women police officers would be appointed into managerial positions and five would be elevated to the rank of CP.” The IGP further noted that the force had over the years put in place gender sensitivity policies, adding that this informed the establishment of the office of the Force Gender Advisor as well as the Gender Unit of the Force Intelligence Bureau. The IGP asked the conference to come up with a communique containing action plans that could assist the police leadership in advancing the interest of women officers. Also speaking, CP, Force Animal Branch, Aishatu Abubakar, said the forum would give the participants the opportunity to brainstorm on issues relating to indiscipline, corruption, the responsibility of women police officers, retirement plan, financial responsibility, social media usage and mentoring. She asked for more roles for women police officers, noting that they could perform well with the level of their intelligence and persuasive skills.
