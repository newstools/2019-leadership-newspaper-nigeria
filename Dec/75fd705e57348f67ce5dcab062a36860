Senator Bulus K. Amos, who represents Gombe South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, has presented a bill seeking the establishment of Federal College of Agriculture to be sited in Bambam, Gombe State to the Upper Legislative House. Already, the bill has been read for the first time on the floor of the Red Chamber by the Senate President, Senator Ahmad Lawan. In the bill, Amos, who is the vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Niger Delta, said that the college when established, would develop and offer academic and professional programmes leading to the award of certificates, first degrees, postgraduate diplomas, and higher degrees with emphasis on planning, developmental and adaptive skills in technology, applied sciences, humanities, management, and allied professional disciplines. The lawmaker in a statement issued by his media aide, Mr. Abdul Lauya, after the bill passed through first reading on Wednesday, explained that as an agrarian state, a federal college of agriculture is desirable in the community to promote sound basic agricultural training as a foundation for food security and national development. Senator Amos said that the proposed college is also expected to collaborate with other national and international institutions involved in training, research and development of agriculture education to promote governance, leadership and management skills among agricultural managers. Among the objectives of the college are to â€œidentify agricultural needs of the society with a view to finding solutions to them within the context of overall national development, provide and promote sound basic agriculture educational training as a foundation for the development of Nigeria, taking into account indigenous culture and need to enhance national unity, and provide higher education in agriculture and foster a systematic advancement of science and agriculture.
