An Arik Air aircraft, a Boeing 737-700 NG aircraft operating flight W3 740 from Lagos to Port Harcourt on Christmas Day morning made an air return back to Lagos due to oil indication light. In an official statement issued yesterday signed by the airline’s PR & Communications Manager, Adebanji Ola, the carrier stated that “the aircraft was on its climb when the pilot in command noticed the indication light and as a safety precaution opted to return to airport of departure, Lagos. The Captain contacted the Lagos control tower to intimate the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) of his decision and activated emergency protocols. This is a standard operating procedure and in line with best safety standards. It further stated that “the Port Harcourt bound passengers have been provided another aircraft for their journey while our team of engineers are inspecting the Boeing that returned to ramp”. The airline therefore, assures its customers that it will not compromise the high safety standards the airline is known for.
