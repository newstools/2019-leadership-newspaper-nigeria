The federal government has approved the sum of N40 billion for road projects in Kano and Bauchi states.
The minister of Works and Housing , Babatunde Fashola disclosed this to State House correspondents after the federal executive council meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said the Ministry of Works and Housing presented two memoranda seeking approval of the Federal Executive Council.
According to him “The other was the approval of two roads the Tagwai- Kansa road to Doguwa in Kano for N8.436 billion and Alkaleri to Situk Road in Bauchi State for N32.015 billion, these are roads that were in the 2019 budget. ”So this is part of the implementation of the 2019 budget before the end of the hear. Council also approved the variation.” He said the first memorandum was to resolve conflicts existing in the contracts so that the roads can be completed.
“There are two of our contractors working in contiguous locations on the Ijebu-Igbo – Onomi road toward the Oyo State border which is in Ogun State and also the Ijebu-Igbo Ita-Igba – Owonowe to Ibadan connecting Oyo and Ogun State. So council approved the revision, the rescope of work between the two contractors at the existing contract price. ”So it’s just a revision of the rescope of works because we are not changing the contract price, we are assigning responsibilities because it was an existing council approval we couldn’t vary it in the ministry, we had to come back,” he added. During his briefing, minister of State, Health Senator Mamora said the council approved the purchase of 15 operational vehicles by NAFDAC at the cost of N307.562 million which essentially are meant to improve mobility.
He noted that NAFDAC is a regulatory agency and has a lot to do in terms of fieldwork. Also, minister of Sports, Sunday Dare announced that the World Heavyweight Champion, Anthony Joshua will be presenting his belts to the President in a matter of days.
