Tech expert has called on youths to embrace ICT as a means to reduce unemployment and as a lucrative career path. Founder of React Native Nigeria, Oluwatobi Shokunbi made this call in Abuja during a free ICT training and empowerment workshop tagged “React Native Nigeria Workshop”, aimed at empowering interested youths in the area of mobile application development and also a community to help developers meet and  connect with each other. Oluwatobi noted that Nigeria is a potential market for ICT and as such a huge opportunity for youths to build  a career around the wide and lucrative industry. “if we really want to put Nigeria on the same level as other countries that are up there in terms of tech advancement, we will see that there is still a whole lot to do. That is why Nigeria is a potential market when it come to ICT and tech development. “For instance, if you go to china and you want to make a food ordering system, the competition is high because you will see over 300 who can actually develop such a system for you, where as in Nigeria, it is not so. We are not even at that level of technology where alot of things have been invented yet compared to some countries where you have self driven cars and other high level technology” He lamented over the rate of talent exporting in Nigeria, as lots of talented youths in the country are being employed and taken away by businesses and organizations in other countries. Oluwatobi made a wake up call to all Nigerians, as these talents are highly needed in advancing Nigeria’s ICT goals. Co-founder of Reactive Native Nigeria, Mosolasi Akinyemi also speaking at the workshop, said that compared to other sector, there is a huge gap in terms of job market and availability as the ICT field has proven to be a huge sector with lots of opportunities to be grabbed.
