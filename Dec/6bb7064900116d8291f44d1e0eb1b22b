The acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, has advised Nigerians to protect their finances against potential attack from fraudsters who would want to take advantage of the festive season to illegally enrich themselves. Magu gave the charge in Ibadan on Wednesday while featuring on ‘Pacesetter’, a live programmes of the African Independent Television, AIT, Ibadan station. The EFCC chief, who was represented by the Commission’s Ibadan Zonal Head, Friday Ebelo, said bank account owners must keep their personal information personal, and should refrain from sharing them with any other person, particularly those acting under the guise of being officials of their bank. “Keep safe. Your personal information is personal. Don’t share it with anyone. If anyone calls you to ask for your ATM PIN and other sensitive data, claiming to be calling from your bank, don’t disclose those data to him. You should rather go to your bank for inquiry. You may be shock to know that such call never emanated from your bank.” he said. While warning against allowing fraudsters to use people’s account for fraudulent purposes, Magu caution against breaking the paper trail half-way. “If someone pleads with you to use your account to collect money, you may not deny him. Just ensure that you don’t withdraw and give him cash. Ask him to give you an account to transfer the money to. “By that, the paper trail will not stop with you because if it stops with you, you will have questions to answer when it is time to investigate the fraud”.
