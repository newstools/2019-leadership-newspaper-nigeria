President Muhammadu Buhari and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdelfattah el-Sisi, have pledged to mobilise their countries’ resources and security personnel to eradicate terrorism in various parts of Africa. During an audience with the Egyptian leader on the sidelines of the “Aswan Forum on Sustainable Peace and Development in Africa” holding in Egypt, President Buhari said that countries in the West African sub-region were in close collaboration towards combatting terrorism by setting up a multinational task force. Buhari said that since terrorism was a global problem, more collaborative efforts were needed to check the menace. In a statement issued by Buhari’s media aide, Femi Adesina, on the parley between the two leaders, he said that “together with other West African leaders, we are working hard to ensure that terrorism is eradicated. It is also important that the conflicts in North Africa particularly in Libya do not frustrate our efforts. We seek your cooperation in this regard.” President el-Sisi expressed his appreciation to President Buhari for honouring the invitation to participate in the forum and for his contributions. He praised the Nigerian president for his leadership qualities and pledged to deepen cooperation with Nigeria in areas of common interest. El-Sisi briefed Buhari on the efforts of his government on counter terrorism, particularly on the Sinai and the borders with Libya. He reiterated his willingness to synergise with the Nigerian government on all fronts to conquer the “evil of terrorism.” The Egyptian president thereafter invited Buhari to the opening of the new capital and the Grand International Museum in October 2020.
