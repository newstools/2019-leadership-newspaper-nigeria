Nigeria’s pension fund assets has risen to N9.81 trillion at the end of October 2019, adding N220 billion from the N9.58 trillion it was at the end of September this year. The pension assets had earlier soared significantly by about N280 billion in two months, that is, in July and August 2019, having climbed from N9.32 trillion as at June 2019, to the aforementioned figure as at the end of August 2019. Moreover, the funds also added more pounds of flesh between March and June, 2019, hence, stood at N9.03 trillion in March and grew to N9.32 trillion in June, 2019. This represents an increase of N294.9 billion within the space of three months, translating to 3.2 percentage growth within this period. The consistent rise in the volume of the nation’s pension assets, according to LEADERSHIP investigation, was attributable to new pension contributions received, interest from fixed income securities and net realised on equities and mutual fund investments. Investment income, according to LEADERSHIP investigation, was instrumental to the continuous growth in pension fund, despite the fact that government at the state and federal levels are not paying the monthly pension contributions of their workers as and when due. A document sourced from the National Pension Commission (PenCom) on Wednesday showed that N6.91 trillion of the assets was invested in Federal Government of Nigeria securities. PenCom, in its monthly summary of pension fund assets, equally noted that pension fund operators invested N4.58 trillion amounting to 46.66 per cent in FGN Bonds; N2.23 trillion in Treasury Bills (22.82 per cent); N5.40 billion in Agency Bonds (NMRC & FMBN), (0.06 per cent); N71.13 billion in Sukku (0.72 per cent) and N15.85 billion in Green bonds, (0.16 per cent) PenCom noted that in line the Multi-fund structure, Retirement Saving Account (RSA) Fund 1, N20.77 billion was invested; RSA Fund 11, N4.26 trillion; RSA Fund 111, N2.43 trillion and RSA Fund IV, N778.03 billion. It stated that N4.75.68 billion, which is 4.85 per cent of the funds, was invested in domestic ordinary shares, while N66.98 billion, amounting to 0.68 per cent in foreign ordinary shares. The pension industry regulator maintained that pension operators invested N127.21 billion (1.30 per cent) in State Government’s Securities; Corporate bonds got N308.44 billion (6.08 per cent); Corporate Infrastructure bonds, received N12.26 billion, (0.13 per cent); Corporate Green bonds, N29.99 billion(0.31 per cent) Supra-National Bonds got N4.07 billion (0.04 per cent); local money market, N1.15 trillion, (11.73 per cent) commercial papers, N97.85 billion (1.00 per cent); Banks, N1.05 trillion (10.73 per cent). Speaking at the 2019 Journalists’ Workshop organised by PenCom in Benin, Edo State recently, the acting director-general, PenCom, Mrs. Aisha Dahir-Umar said, the number of registered contributors under the CPS has grown to 8.85 million, while pension fund assets have grown to N9.58 trillion as at the end of September. This growth, she said, justifies PenCom’s emphasis on the safety of pension funds as the bedrock of sustaining the CPS, assuring all stakeholders that the pension reform remains steadily on course. “These modest milestones notwithstanding, the commission and pension operators are committed to actualising the growth potentials of the pension industry,” Dahir-Umar, who was represented by the head, Micro Pension Department, Mr. Kunle Odebiyi, pointed out.
