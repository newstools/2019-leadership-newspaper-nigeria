A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, has called on Christians to imbibe the teachings of Jesus Christ as they celebrate the 2019 Christmas season. He said the teachings and lifestyle of Jesus Christ revolved around love as enunciated by the Holy Bible, emphasizing that love brings forgiveness, strengthens peace, reinforces unity, provokes charity, consumes all forms of bitterness and exalts a nation through righteousness. Eze, in a Christmas message made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, said there is the need for Nigerians to do more towards strengthening the nation’s bond of unity which seems to be under severe threat by forces of national disintegration and secessionists propagators. While congratulating Christians, the APC chieftain urged the ambassadors of Christ to continue to pray always for the country and her leaders especially for divine direction in critical decisions and moments of challenges. He commends and congratulated his media aides and hundreds of media partners for all that they contributed to make his media team one of the most vibrant, vocal and dreaded media team in Nigeria today. Eze said: “As we approach 2020, let us prepare ourselves for a greater outing, hoping that the political system will appreciate most of our deeds this time around. “In the spirit of Christmas, I ask for forgiveness particularly to those that I couldn’t send anything for this season and in areas that I was found wanting and plead for patience as the year have been a bit tough and difficult but hopes that 2020 will be better for us all.” He thanked most of his political leaders who have stood by him even at the period his life and that of his family was under threat by some of those who felt threatened by his bold steps to expose their plots against a virile, egalitarian, vibrant, united, progressive and better Nigeria.
