The National Library of Nigeria (NLN) has intensified efforts towards the achievement of its mandates, with the purchase of two operational vehicles deployed solely for the use of state branches in roving to collect legal deposit materials. In a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the Library, Vershima Orvell-Dio, the National Librarian, Professor Lenrie Olatokunbo Aina revealed this yesterday, at a sensitization workshop organised for key stakeholders in the publishing industry, held at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria. Prof. Aina stated that “The National Library has the responsibility to collect publications emanating from Nigeria, publications about Nigeria and any work authored by Nigerians anywhere in the world. “However, this responsibility is facing the challenge of non-compliance, by publishers and authors, despite the legal deposit collection provisions as espoused in our enabling Act. This is why we have intensified efforts in sensitizing the public about this obligation. But beyond that, we have purchased dedicated vehicles for our state branches, which will be on a continuous visit to publishing outlets, collecting the publications.” He added that “because there has been a growing concern about the non-compliance by most publishers, authors, printers, academicians and government printers with international standards for publishing, the sensitization activities have also been focusing on adherence to publishing standards through the obtaining of International Book Number (ISBN) for books, monographs, reports, etc and International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) for journals, newspapers, magazines, etc by all categories of producers of publications.”
