Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, has said that the state government is working to integrate artisanal miners into the licenced and regulated mining programme that adheres to strict procedures in order to avoid consequences of illegal mining in the future. He also warned against illegal mining in the state which he says does not only put the lives of people at risk, but also leads to loss of revenues accruing to government. It would be recalled that seven  people  died as a result of mining site collapse in Zawan in Jos South local government area. Governor Lalong in a statement issued by the director of Press and Public Affairs, Makut Simon Macham  said he is saddened by the death of the young citizens whose lives have been cut short as a result of the tragic incident. He commiserated with their families and described the development as unfortunate while directing  the Ministry of Mineral Development to immediately investigate circumstances leading to the tragic incident for proper actions to be taken. The governor also directed the State Ministry of Health to give the injured victims adequate attention and the very best of care possible adding that henceforth, the Ministry of Solid Minerals and relevant agencies must step up supervision of the sector to ensure that all safety standards are adhered to.
