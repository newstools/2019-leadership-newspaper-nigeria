President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated veteran journalist and one of the founding fathers of state radio stations in the country, Chief Abiodun Adeniyi on his 80th birthday today. Adeniyi, with about six decades of journalism experience tucked under his belt, was one of the pioneer staff of Radio Lagos, where he rose to commanding heights, before retiring into advertising practice, where he equally made a grand showing. President Buhari in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, commended his commitment to the journalism profession, where he mentored many generations of younger professionals. The President wished Chief Adeniyi longer life, in good health, and urges him to continually make his wealth of experience available to the country, and younger generation of journalists. “I join your family, friends and associates who rejoice with you and ask that God gives you many more occasions to celebrate,” President Buhari said.
