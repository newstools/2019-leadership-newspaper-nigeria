Binyeri Community in Adamawa have urged Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri to of Adamawa to reconstruct the failed 58 km Mayo-Belwa Binyeri road abandoned for decades. The community made the call Thursday in a statement in Yola by its spokesman, Mr Suleiman Mohammed-Tola. Mohammed-Tola noted that the road was first constructed in 1981 by the administration of late Governor Abubakar Barde in the second republic to connect Taraba State, but had suffered neglect in the last 29 years. “This road links Sebore-Tola-Binyeri totaling a distance of 39.8km with four (4) bridges and twelve (12) culverts. However, one of the bridges and three culverts had collapsed due to floods at Dayino and Tasau villages thereby making life unbearable to the residents, visitors and motorists plying the route,’’ Mohammed-Tola cried. According to him, the area has an estimated population of about one million with four major local markets and two motor parks generating a conservative N3m monthly for the Local and State Governments. “This record is second to Mayo Belwa town, the local government headquarters”, Mohammed-Tola said. While commending the Federal Government for embarking on the reconstruction of 18-km Mayo Belwa- Sebore road, Mohammed-Tola also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the early completion of the Mayo Belwa-Jada road project. Besides, the journalist said Tola-Binyeri District is endowed with solid mineral deposits in commercial quantity. “Barite, iron, mica, marble, granite, tantalite, magnesium, limestone, uranium and gypsum, among others, are being mined unconventionally at the Gambe and Pola hills. “Our people are largely agrarian as we excel in farming and livestock,’’ he stated. In addition, he appealed to the state government to restore normal electricity to Tola and Binyeri by fixing failed polls and transmission lines as well as installation of high grade transformers to improve the living standard of the people.
