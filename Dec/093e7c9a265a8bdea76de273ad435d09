The Nigeria Union of Agriculture and Allied Employees (NUAAE) has urged the Federal Ministry of Water Resources to fast-track allocation of lands to their members to enable them commence farming. Chairman, FCT Chapter of NUAAE, Comrade Agha Ukpai Agha made the call at the Agricultural Development Symposium 2019’/Award organised by the Chapter in Abuja on Wednesday. He noted that agriculture is a tool for economic growth of a nation. “Therefore we the workers in the agricultural sector will not fold our arms and watch to the less utilization of resources of this sector,” Dr. Agha said. He urged Nigerians to support the federal government’s commitment towards revamping the sector. The Chairman said members have benefited from different trainings and packages. “It is also important to note that the council has also negotiated with the Federal Ministry of Water Resources for some hectares of land to enable members embark on rice and cassava farming,” he added. In a goodwill message, Director-General/Chief Executive Officer, National Biosafety Management Agency, NBMA, Dr. Rufus Ebegba suggested that civil servants should continue to receive salary until their entitlement is paid.
