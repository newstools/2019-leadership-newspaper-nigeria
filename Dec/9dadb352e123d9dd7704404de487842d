National Chairman of Action Alliance (AA) Chief Kenneth Udeze has hailed the Supreme Court judgment  which has finally nailed the governorship ambition of Chief Uche Nwosu , insisting that the Apex court ruling has vindicated his party. The  national chairman, in a statement made available to journalists, declared that the judgement was in line with the earlier decision of the party to withdraw from the petition filed before the election tribunal by Chief Nwosu challenging the victory of governor Emeka Ihedioha in the last governorship poll . He said, “we maintain that Uche Nwosu was never our candidate in the March  governorship election for Imo State, having falsely presented himself to the party as having nothing to do with APC as an aspirants and lied to the party with true state of his affairs with other parties. He, however, commended the national chairman of Action People Party (APP) Chief Ikenga Ugochinyere  for championing this struggle that culminated in the ruling by the supreme Court. “Let me use this  opportunity to thank  Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere -led National Executive of APP on the Party’s final triumph in the supreme court today putting a permanent halt the activities of aspirants who jump from one party to the other looking for party tickets without disclosing thier original stake with other parties. “We thank God for also intervening in the state of the State of Imo where the elected governor’s time has been wasted by unwarranted and frivolous court action. “The withdrawal of AA from the election petition tribunal in the first place was beyond the imagination of some political watchers as what the party did was for the best interest of the party, to save the soul of the party and for the general well-being of Ndi Imo after studying the action filed by the APP at the Federal High court and noting that the party is wasting its time after all. “Never again shall politician resort to all forms of blackmail and intimidation to grab the structure of political parties for their selfish interest. AA have shown resilience and steadfastness in its belief as a masses party by its action in the political development of Imo state and Nigeria.
