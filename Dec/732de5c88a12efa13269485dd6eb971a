The Borno State governor, Babagana Umara Zulum, has vowed to prosecute any ghost worker on the payroll of the local government councils in the state. He also promised the same treatment for those found to have added names of ghost workers in the local councils. Zulum, who handed down the warning yesterday when he paid a homage on the Emir of Askira, Alhaji Abdullahi Muhammadu Askirama , in Askura, the headquarters of Askira Uba local government area of Borno State, noted that each month, government spends N90 million on payment of workers’ salary , who constitute less than one per cent of the population of the local goverment, leaving education, health, infrasturature, and water supply to suffer. “ We will not allow this to continue. We are carrying out verification exercise in the local government and I urge you to cooperate with the committee. “I will not spare any ghost worker found on the payroll of the local government no matter how highly placed he or she may be. Local government is to bring development to the grassroot, we will not tolerate a situation where only few will consume the money meant for majority at the detriment of majority,” he said.
