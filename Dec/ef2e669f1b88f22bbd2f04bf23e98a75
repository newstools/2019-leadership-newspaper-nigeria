President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi on Wednesday said that the Nigerian poor and downtrodden have nothing to celebrate their Christmas. Ogunyemi stated that the situation is the country has made life unbearable for the Nigerian masses while the few rich continue to enrich themselves at the expense of the majority. The ASUU president in a message sent to members of the union to mark Christmas, urged members to look back with thanksgiving. He asked them to prepare for challenges ahead in the New Year. According to him, worsening state of the Nigerian economy had hit the poor masses below the belt and made the yuletide period meaningless. He noted that celebration was more meaningful when the ordinary Nigerians have access to qualitative education, healthcare and other good things of life. “There are indications that the tertiary education sector will be charged up next year following refusal of ASUU members to enroll on IPPIS. “Findings have however showed that lecturers in public institutions have been paid their December salary despite not enrolling on the IPPIS. “Comrades & compatriots, as we join the rest of the world for the Christmas and New Year holidays, let’s look back with thanksgiving and prepare for the challenges of the future. “The season of love reminds us of our obligations to the poor and downtrodden. Its celebration is more meaningful when the ordinary Nigerians have access to qualitative education, healthcare, and other good things of life. Happy holidays, as the struggle continues!’’ Ogunyemi said.
