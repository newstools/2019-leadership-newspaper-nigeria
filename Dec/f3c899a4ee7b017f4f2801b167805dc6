The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), has assured that it would complete the N19 billion Karshi water project in record time to address the challenges of water supply in the satellite towns, especially in Karshi, Orozo, Kurudu and other communities. FCT minister of state, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, who gave the assurance during a tour of facilities in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) yesterday, also revealed that the project has advanced to 45 percent completion. Aliyu stated the administration was determined to ensure that both the satellite towns and most of the new districts have water, stressing that the construction of Coffer dam in Karshi would ease the supply of water to other satellite towns when completed. The minister also assured that when the dam is completed, there would be enough water for the satellite towns, which would also generate employment and increase economic activities and other socio-economic activities. Also speaking, the director of Satellite Towns Development Department (STDD), Engr. Felix Nwankwo, who was part of the tour, explained that water would be generated from the nearby stream in addition to rain water, adding that the move would curtain flooding usually experienced in some parts of Karshi. “We have a very small stream, but because we are going to have rainfall, once we block it, we are going to retain water. Last year we have so much flooding in Karshi, those water will no longer be seen when the dam is completed because all of them will be retained within the dam structure.”
