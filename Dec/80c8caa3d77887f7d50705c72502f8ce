The federal government has been urged to openly prosecute all those behind the alleged embezzlement  of  over N40bnTax-Payers money expended  in the name of 2019 general elections campaigns. A group by the name  Budget Advocacy and Reforms Association, said the alleged financial scandal would be used to probe the present administration on the fight against bribery and corruption. Speaking during a media chat in Kano, the group chief executive, Dr Abdullahi Ya’u, insisted that whoever is found wanting  in the alleged financial scandal should be allowed to face the law. The group further welcome the recent initiative of opening a treasury portal under the office of the Accountant General of the Federation. Yau called for “wide sensitisation of the general public on effective and frequent utilization of the portal, adequate space for uploading feedbacks, including pictures of evidence from citizens based on their observations. He also called for the engagement of the civil society organisations and media houses to mobilise the public on the effective usage of the portal.” The group also recommended that “the accountant-general of the federation, as the host of the portal, should encourage the 36 states of the federation on how to launch similar iconic initiative so as to deepen the transparency objective of this present administration.” “The open treasury policy is a paradigm shift that is timely and will go a long way in supporting open governance and transparency in line with digitalization of public accounting system that resonates with fast growing global digitalization of governance must not be left behind. “The policy provides means of tracking government financial release thereby bringing more citizens participation in governance. It also provides opportunity for citizens involvement in budget implementation efforts of all MDAs.
