The leadership of Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) has raised the alarm over systematic replacement of Nigerian workers with machines. The President, Comrade Oyinkan Olasanoye who made this known in Lagos also called on federal government to halt the move as it would adversely affect Nigerian workers. “We are aware of plan by some companies to replace human beings with robots. And if this is allowed to happen, then many people will lose their jobs to robots. Remember that one Nigerian worker has about 10 immediate and extended families and mouths to feed. We are using this medium to call on federal government to halt the plan to replace human beings with robots.” However, she encouraged Nigerian workers, especially those in the banking, insurance and other financial institutions to embark on training and retraining of its workers to enable them adopt technology in their workplace.
