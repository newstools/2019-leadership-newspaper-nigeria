The 9th House of Representatives makes history as it sets to establish, the first library for the national assembly, just as it promises to reform the electoral laws and pass the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB). The speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, according to a statement by the media office of the National Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies disclosed this while declaring open a two-day seminar on Improving Legislative Performance Through Effective Committee Management, designed for chairmen of standing and special committees in the 9th House of Representatives in Lagos. While noting that the legislature is the conscience of a nation, the speaker said it was incumbent on legislators to articulate through legislation, the broad objectives of nationhood and through oversight, hold the executive accountable to those objectives. “The standing committees you each lead, are the principal instruments of legislation and of oversight. Whatever we are, whatever we will achieve, and everything we will be remembered for in this house of representatives, depends on how well your committees function and how effectively, you serve as leaders of those committees. The opportunity provided by this seminar, is the first necessary step towards achieving the other high objectives to which we have committed ourselves, individually and as a house,” he said. Expressing dismay at the lack of deep institutional memory, Gbajabiamila added, “Unfortunately, archiving and record-keeping within the national assembly still falls below the standards we require. However, do not allow this to keep you from seeking out historical information about the committees you lead. In studying the history of your committees, what was done, what was achieved, and what wasn’t, you will find context that will be helpful to your own endeavors, and allow you to avoid landmines you didn’t know existed.” Gbajabiamila charged the chairmen of committees to take the 9th House of Representatives Assembly to an unprecedented height by leaving a lasting legacy
