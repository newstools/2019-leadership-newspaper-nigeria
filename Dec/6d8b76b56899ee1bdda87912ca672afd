A coalition of over 180 civil society organisation, Civil Society Groups for Good Governance (CSGGG) has endorsed the recent Teachers Certification Examination carried out by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TCRN), urging all teachers to adhere and comply with the exercise. Speaking during a press briefing at the groups’ secretariat in Abuja yesterday, the president of CSGGG, Comrade Ogakwu Dominic described the activities of the TCRN, as a panacea to improve the quality of the educational standard in Nigeria. According to him, “We fully endorse the certification exercise of the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria and applaud the management for a job well done in ensuring that there are regulation and control of the teaching profession at all levels of the Nigerian Education System, both in the public and the private sectors. “TRCN is the only professional agency that identifies with all professional associations and unions at all levels of education, irrespective of level, its certification is acceptable both in the local and international practices. ‘’Teachers are therefore on this note, advised to comply with all regulatory policies, as the students’ poor performance over time, have been linked to poor teachers training and certification hence penalty await those who flout the rules,” he added. He said teachers are channeled to groom great leaders of tomorrow and in this 21st century where technology has become the order of the day, it is however important that teachers become computer savvy in other to meet up with the 21st century academic challenges. The president, however, called on the minister of Education Mallam Adamu Adamu to support the management of TCRN led by Prof. Josiah Olusegun Ajiboye towards achieving the act setting up the council. He also urged the council to commit to continual training of teachers as part of updating their knowledge base in meeting up with the 21st-century challenges as a means of achieving a great result in the nation’s educational sector.
