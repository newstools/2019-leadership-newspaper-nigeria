African Alliance Plc has fulfilled its obligation to its policyholders by paying N6 billion claims to customers who suffered insured risks from Q3 2018 to the third quarter of the current year. This, according to the insurer, was to keep up with its promises of maintaining customer amazement. Speaking at a press briefing in Lagos recently, the managing director/CEO, African Alliance, Mrs. Funmi Omo, while listing the giant strides the firm has made in less than two years, restated the management’s commitment to sustaining the upward growth trajectory across all metrics. “Ours is a business that has seen it all and survived it all. Our position in just two years compared to now is testament to the unstinting leadership and guidance of our Board, the relentless drive of the executive management and a most committed and flexible staff who never shies away from challenges in any form,’’ Omo said. The firm’s premium income grew by 68 per cent from N3 billion at the end of Q3, 2018 to N5.12 billion at the end of Q3, 2019. In her submission,  executive director, Finance, Olabisi Adekola, added that the firm’s all round growth earned it a ‘stable outlook’ and Bb+ by Agusto, foremost financial ratings agency in Nigeria. “That Agusto rated us Bbb+ is a win for us, considering where we were. But we are not relenting, all hands are on deck to sustain this growth and earn a most elite rating consistent with the elite investments we have made in the business,” she pointed. On the company’s recapitalisation plans, Funmi Omo said: “NAICOM gave a ‘No Objection’ to our plans which means we are on course. Come June 2020, you will see how far we have come. We do not say we are with you for life for fun; we mean every word.” African Alliance is a publicly quoted life insurance company incorporated in 1960. The firm operates out of the corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos as well as in 18 branches nationwide.
