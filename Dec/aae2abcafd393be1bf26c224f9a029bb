A group, the Youth and Environmental Advocacy Centre (YEAC), has said it is mobilizing one million youth volunteers to lead the campaign for the defence of human rights in states in the Niger Delta region. YEAC Executive Director, Fyneface Dumnamene, disclosed this while speaking at an event to mark the International Human Rights Day in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. Dumnamene, who listed the states to include; Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo and Rivers, said the youth volunteers will campaign as climate change and environmental justice activists. He expressed regrets that despite all the funds that has poured into the Niger Delta region through many interventionist agencies, social packages and development schemes, the region remains poverty-stricken with bad roads, lack of water shelter, hunger and diseases. Speaking at the event, former Vice Chancellor of the Rivers State University, Professor Barinua Fakae, stressed the importance of the environment and its sanity to the society, especially to the youth. Fakae therefore called on youths in the Niger Delta region to be in the vanguard for a safe environment for the future. In her keynote address, a senior lecturer in the Department of Theatre Arts, University of Port Harcourt, Professor Juli Umukoro, advocated for a revolution, in order to effect a change for a better society. Umukoro regretted that most people in Nigeria view revolution from derogatory perspective, saying: “Revolution is not anathema because the world constantly desire change for good.” The University don, who also expressed regrets that Nigeria’s human right is only on paper, said human right encompasses all rights and freedoms including but not limited to environment, politics and social justice.
