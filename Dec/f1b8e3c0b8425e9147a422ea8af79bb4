The director, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Pilgrims Welfare Board, Dabara Audu Vingo, has disclosed that the board is under serious pressure from Nigerians to sponsor more pilgrims to the holy lands of Israel, Rome and Egypt. Vingo, who disclosed this at the weekend in Abuja, during the end-of-year press briefing, noted however, that though there was an increase in government sponsorship of pilgrims and in the number of editions, from one to four, within the same period, that a lot still needed to be done, especially in the area of funding. He noted that early and prompt release of funds by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) for pilgrimage activities was behind the hitch-free conduct of Christian pilgrimage in the FCT. The director noted that there has been increase in private sponsorship of Christian pilgrimage due to constant sensitization campaigns in the media, churches, companies, market places and others. He however regretted that after completion of preparatory arrangements in Nigeria, that some pilgrims are sometimes absent at the departure point due to circumstances beyond their control, adding that the aircraft sometimes flies with empty seats, because early notices were not usually given by the pilgrims who could not turn up. Vingo also revealed that the board recorded zero-level abscondment in 2019, just as he called on intending pilgrims to always disclose any illness that could require medical attention, adding that pilgrimage was a rigorous and stressful exercise. In order to eliminate challenges associated with the exercise, the director called on the Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission (NCPC) to provide more funding for the exercise and to engage more than one aircraft of larger capacity for faster and easier airlifting of pilgrims.
