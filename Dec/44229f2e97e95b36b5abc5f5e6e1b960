The Chief of Defence Staff General Gabriel Olonisakin, commissioned two blocks of 54 accommodation for soldiers, ratings, airmen and airwomen serving under the Defence Headquarters. General Olonisakin who was represented by the Chief of Defence Logistics, Major General Adekunle Shodunke said the project was in fulfillment of the CDS vision “to ensure a well-motivated, trained and equipped Armed Forces that is responsive to national security commitments” He said the Armed Forces of Nigeria has been confronted with the challenges of accommodation to cater for its increasing number personnel hence the aggressive construction scheme embarked upon to breach the gap created by dearth of Barracks accommodations. He noted that the commissioning of the 54 flats will go a long way in alleviating accommodation challenges facing personnel of the Defence Headquarters. The CDS recalled that not long ago, 156 flats were commissioned for soldiers at Mambilla Barracks while another block of 114 flats were commissioned for officers at Mogadishu Cantonment. “Today, it gladdens my heart that the accommodation blocks we are commissioning is also furnished to taste with essential electronic appliances, beddings, chairs, tables, kitchen utensils and other items for comfort of beneficiaries.,” While congratulating the beneficiaries, General Olonisakin charged them good use of the facilities and maintain them as sanction will be made for those damaging them. “I would like to exhort them to make good use of the facilities provided. The popular saying, ‘soldiers go soldiers come but Barracks remain’ is a subtle reminder that the facilities provided in these flats are government property and conscious efforts must be made to protect them as well as keep them in good shape. “Anyone found damaging, removing or engaging in destructive handling of any of the facilities will be sanctioned appropriately,” he warned Earlier, the Chief of Defence Engineering Services Major General John Enenche said the accommodation which sits on a 1.5 metre raft foundation was designed to stand the taste of time. He said the foundation alone cost a whooping N45m with direct labour.
