Analysing the performance by sectors, the Consumer Goods sector supported the performance of the market, as the index gained 4.69 per cent due to price appreciation in Cadbury Nigeria, Dangote Sugar Refinery and Nestle Nigeria, while the Industrial Goods index advanced 0.35 per cent following buying interest in Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN) and Courteville Business Solutions. However, the Banking index led the laggards by 0.68 per cent due to sell pressure in FBN Holdings, Access Bank and United Bank for Africa (UBA). The Oil & Gas and Insurance indices also shed 0.43 per cent and 0.07 per cent, underpinned by price depreciation in Oando, Cornerstone Insurance and Continental Reinsurance. Market breadth closed slightly negative with 31 gainers and 32 losers. Neimeth International Pharmaceuticals led the gainers table by 30.36 per cent to close at 73 kobo per share.

After four successive week-on-week price appreciation of many of investor’s choice stocks, analysts at GTI Securities Limited said that “We anticipate to see some profit taking by short term investors in the coming week. However, we do not rule out the possibility of seeing further staking by active investors due to the declining yields in the fixed income space.” Also, analysts at Cordros Capital Limited noted that despite the marginally positive performance of the market last week, the market seems to once again be losing impetus.
