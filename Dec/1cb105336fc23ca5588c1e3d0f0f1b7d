Some youths of Tsekelewu/Polobubou communities in Egbema Kingdom, Warri North, Delta State, has absolved their leader, Comrade Marvis Ofeyai, of sponsoring attack on multinational oil companies operating in the communities. The allegation is coming following renewed unrest and attack on oil workers by some youths in the oil producing communities. Piqued by the development, Comrade Ofeyai, in a statement released in Benin  City, yesterday explained that  the communities and the oil companies have over the years maintained a cordial relationship and can never be part of any act of hooliganism and attack on the oil companies. He said the allegation against the leadership of the group was a calculated and cheap blackmail aimed at tarnishing his hard earn reputation and therefore appealed to security agencies to unravel those behind the speculations. Debunking the allegation he noted :  “I have a good relationship with the various multinationals such as Chevron, NPDC and others companies operating in our communities. My relationship with the multinationals has been cordial for quite a numbers of years since I became the leader of my community. “Why will some outcast gang up against my person by confessing that am their sponsor for kidnapping and distribution of fire arms to eradicate the peaceful co-existence which we have been enjoying in my community all these years? “I want to let the government and the entire world know that I am innocent and as such, I will not truncate the benefit that Chevron, NPDC, Delta State government and the federal government have brought to our community in form of corporate social responsibility that we have been enjoying. Some people are only trying to blackmail me because they have since realized that I stood for community interest as against selfish interest”.
