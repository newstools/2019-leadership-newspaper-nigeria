Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde, at the weekend said his government was on the same page with civil servants on the new N30,000 minimum wage for workers. The Governor, who noted that his administration had only on Friday set up a committee to oversee the negotiation and implementation of the new minimum wage, stated that civil servants and the government were going to be reasonable on the all-important matter. The Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Taiwo Adisa, Makinde made the disclosure during the quarterly live interview programme, “Meet the Governor”, on the Broadcasting Corporation of Oyo State (BCOS).  The statement added that the Governor alerted the people to a number of noticeable achievements and deliverables recorded by his administration within the last 200 days, just as he informed that his administration was able to deliver so far due to prudent management of resources.  The governor also said that he and members of his administration have been making sacrifices, as according to him, service to the people has been of uppermost concern.  Makinde stated that his government has never kept the organised Labour in the state and all stakeholders in dark over the resources accruing to the state.  He added that though the state was already aware of the cost implication of the new minimum wage, the government and the civil servants would be reasonable because they were heading in the same direction of delivering good governance and development to Oyo State. The governor, who addressed a wide range of issues raised by the three-man panel of interviewers and residents of the states who made phone calls into the programme, said that though the government had been getting a good report about security in the state following the immense efforts of the administration in redesigning the security architecture; distribution of security vehicles and procurement of communication equipment, among other steps, it was not going to rest on its oars.  On the issue of the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Makinde maintained the committee set up by the state to negotiate with a similar committee from Osun State had been given one term of reference, to negotiate separation of ownership from Osun State, adding that he was confident that with the quality of individuals on the committee, the state would get a positive result.
