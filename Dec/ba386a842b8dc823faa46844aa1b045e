In just two months, the total assets and liabilities of commercial banks in Nigeria have risen by 4.6 per cent to N41.425 trillion, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said. Amid the impressive performance in September and October of the outgoing year, the banks, however, recorded a slight dip in loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) of 0.3 percentage points from 62.1 per cent to 61.9 per cent at the end of October. This is contained in the Economic Report for November released by the CBN. According to the report, commercial banks’ credit to the domestic economy rose by 0.6 per cent to N22.26 trillion at end of October 2019, compared to N22.103 trillion in the previous month. The level of growth in credit, however, dropped from 1.4 per cent in September to 0.6 per cent in October. The total assets and liabilities of the commercial banks amounted to N41.425 trillion at end of October 2019, indicating a 4.6 per cent increase, compared with N39.611 trillion at the end of the preceding month. The CBN said that funds were sourced, mainly from increases in unclassified liabilities, and the mobilisation of time, savings and foreign currency deposits. The apex bank further explained that the funds were mainly used to acquire unclassified assets, foreign assets and to boost reserves. The report added that total specified liquid assets of the banks stood at N14.27 trillion at the end of October 2019, representing 59.3 per cent of their total current liabilities, compared to N13.774 trillion at the end of September 2019, which represented 59.0 per cent of their total current liabilities. At that level, the liquidity ratio was 0.9 percentage point lower than the level at the end of the preceding month, and was 29.30 percentage points above the stipulated minimum liquidity ratio of 30 per cent. The report also showed that foreign exchange inflow into the CBN rose by 5.8 per cent to $3.72 billion while outflow fell by 12.9 per cent to $4.31billon in November 2019. This resulted in a net outflow of $0.59 billion in November 2019. Total non-oil export receipts by the banks rose by 15.4 per cent above the level in October 2019. The average exchange rate at the inter-bank, the BDC segment, and the Import and Export (I&E) window were N306.93, N359, and N362.66 to the dollar respectively in the reviewed month. The external sector performance improved in the reviewed month due to increase in the international price of crude oil by 7.5 per cent to $63.56 per barrel. Consequently, aggregate foreign exchange inflow into the CBN, at $3.72 billion, rose by 5.8 per cent, above the level in the preceding month. It, however, showed a decrease of 53 per cent below the level at the end of the corresponding period of 2018. The rise in aggregate foreign exchange inflow into the CBN, relative to the preceding month’s level, was attributed, largely to the rise in both oil and non-oil receipts. The aggregate outflow of foreign exchange from the apex bank fell by 12.9 per cent and 17.3 per cent to $4.31 billion, below the levels at the end of the preceding month and the corresponding period of 2018, respectively. The development, relative to the preceding month’s level, was attributed, mainly to 10.4 per cent and 18.4 per cent decline in interbank utilisation and other official payments, respectively. Overall, foreign exchange flows, through the CBN at end-November 2019 resulted in a net outflow of $0.59 billion, compared to a net outflow of $1.43 billion in the preceding month. It, however, recorded a net inflow of $2.71 billion, when compared to the level in the corresponding period of 2018.
