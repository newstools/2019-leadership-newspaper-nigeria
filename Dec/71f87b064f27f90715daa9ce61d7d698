The High Court of the Federal Capital Territory sitting in Apo has granted an order restraining the reconciliation committee constituted by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, from acting on the activities of the Edo State chapter of the party. Justice Sylvanus Chinedu Oriji in a ruling on December 6, 2019, granted the order of interim injunction in Motion No. M/680/2019 between Mr Stephen Oshawo & 2 Ors v. Comrade Adams Aliu Oshiomhole & 2 Ors. The Judge also stressed that Oshiomhole has no authority to constitute the committee as he has been suspended by relevant organs of the party in his ward and local council levels. The court granted an order viz: “an order of injunction restraining the 2nd Defendant, its agents, members and/or privies from purporting to act as a reconciliation committee as the 1st Defendant, who is the constituting authority has no vires to so do since he has been suspended by the Ward 10 Executive Committee of the 3rd Defendant on the 2nd Day of November 2019 and ratified by the Etsako West Local Government Executive Committee on the 9th day of November, 2019 without an appeal and the seven days period for appeal having elapsed pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice for Interlocutory injunction.” Recall that Comrade Oshiomhole was suspended by Ward 10 Executives of the APC, after which the Etsako West Local Government Executive Committee ratified the suspension. Subsequently, the State Executive Committee of the APC in Edo State upheld the suspension of Comrade Oshiomhole from the party.
