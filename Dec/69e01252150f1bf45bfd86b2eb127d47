Nigerian universities may be shut again if the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) goes ahead with its planned nationwide strike over the federal government’s resolve to stop the salaries of lecturers for shunning the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). ASUU national president, Biodun Ogunyemi, told journalists in Abuja, yesterday, after the union’s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held last weekend at the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State, that the union shall activate its standing resolution of “no pay, no work.” Ogunyemi said that the move by the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) and the Federal Ministry of Finance to impose the IPPIS on Nigeria’s federal universities was part of the government’s plan to distract the union from calling for the conclusion of the truncated re-negotiation of the 2009 Agreement as well as the full implementation of the 7th February, 2019 Memorandum of Action (MoA) the two parties reached. He said: “NEC did not only restate its unequivocal rejection of IPPIS as an ill-wind that will blow the Nigerian university system no good, it also resolved that no amount of blackmail, intimidation and outright misinformation of the Nigerian public will make ASUU lose focus on its historic role as the conscience of the university system.” The ASUU president said that the union was shocked that the OAGF said that IPPIS was meant to comply with global best practices when he cannot tell Nigerians or any other country where IPPIS is extended to the universities as one of the best practices. “We call on all people of goodwill to prevail on the accountant-general to respect university autonomy as the global best practice for the academia,” he said. Ogunyemi argued that that IPPIS shouldn’t have been financed by a World Bank loan if the interests of those behind it were altruistic and saluted the courage of his members for resisting the tactics of the AGF to cunningly migrate them to IPPIS platform. He said: “As resolved at the ASUU-NEC meeting at FUT Minna on 7th-8th December, 2019, should the accountant-general make bold his threat of stopping the salaries of our members, the union shall activate its standing resolution of “no pay, no work.”
