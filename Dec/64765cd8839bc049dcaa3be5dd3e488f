A coalition of civil society groups, Concerned Civil Society Groups for Educational Development and Guardians of Democracy and Development Initiative has commended LEADERSHIP Group for recognising individuals, firms and other organisations for their contributions to Nigeria’s development and unity In a communiqué it issued at its end-of-year meeting in Abuja at the weekend, the coalition comprising 76 groups, said that a system that reprimands wrong doing should equally commend outstanding feats. The CSOs observed that LEADERSHIP has been notable in exposing wrong doings in the society, adding that “it is exciting that the medium also lauds positives in the society.” The convener of the coalition, Prince Danasi Momoh, who signed the communiqué, particularly lauded the conferment on Prof. Suleiman Elias Bogoro, the executive secretary of the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) as the “Public Servant of The Year 2019.” Momoh said that the award had strengthened its due diligent on TETFund and its management earlier in the year. He said: “As a group that has monitored trends in the education sector and pointed out where there were infractions and commended where necessary, we herein note with confidence the uncommon dexterity of Prof. Bogoro in administering TETFUND and thereby lend our voice to the success story of the administrator. “Considering the misfortune of wasted opportunities, maladministration, and lack of transparency in most sectors of the public service, the need to promote quality examples in leadership and administration cannot be overemphasized. “We therefore also adopt him as our ‘Public Servant of the Year’ for the same reasons advanced by LEADERSHIP Newspapers, which are taking development and research to an unprecedented height under his leadership,” Momoh said.
