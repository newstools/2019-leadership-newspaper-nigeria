The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said if the Sultan of Sokoto, His eminence, Sa’ad Abubakar III truly said that christians were not being persecuted in Nigeria simply “because not all Fulanis are muslims,” he got it totally wrong. Apparently reacting to a statement credited to the sultan were he disputed the claim by the CAN that christians were the target of persecution in Nigeria at the closing ceremony of 77th annual Islamic vacation course (IVC) organised by the Muslim Society of Nigeria (MSSN) at Bayero University, Kano. CAN in a statement by its national director, Evangelist Kwamkur Samuel, made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday in Abuja, said the association respects the sultan very much but what he said requires response in order to put things right. “It was painful reading from the media the sultan of Sokoto, His Eminence, Sa’ad Abubakar saying that there was no case of christian persecution in the country where christians are being killed on daily basis and their landed property confiscated. “It would have been better if the sultan had remained quiet the way he did when those killings were taking place. “Recalling the several hundreds of the innocent people whose lives were cut short by the Fulani herdsmen in Southern Kaduna, Benue, Plateau, Adamawa and Taraba States, (states with Christian majority), it is an insult and insensitivity for anyone to be claiming that the unprecedented persecution which victims are well known did not occur.’’
