A 39-year-old man, Akinwande Emmanuel, was on Tuesday brought before an Ota Senior Magistrates’ Court in Ota, Ogun, for allegedly issuing a dud cheque of N2.2 million for a business transaction. Emmanuel, who lives at No. 26, Temidayo Street, Ota, is being tried for issuing a dud cheque. The Prosecutor, Insp. Cynthia Ejezie, told the court that the defendant committed the offence between 2017 and June 23, 2019 at Fumec Filling Station, Km 36, Lagos-Abeokuta Expressway, Ota, Ogun. Ejezie said that the defendant issued a dud cheque to the complainant, Akinwunmi Michael, which “bounced” when Michael presented the cheque to the bank. “The accused issued a dud cheque to Michael knowing that there was no money in his account,” she said. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened Section 419(b) of the Criminal Code, Law of Ogun, 2006. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Senior Magistrate, Mr Shotunde Shotayo, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. Shotayo ordered that the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and they must be gainfully employed with evidence of tax payment to the Ogun Government. The case was adjourned until Feb. 11, for hearing.(NAN)
