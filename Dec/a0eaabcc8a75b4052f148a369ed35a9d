The Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED) has stated that from October 2018 to June 2019, the 10 distribution companies (DisCos) in the country raised their energy revenue collection to N466billion, adding that they raised their collection efficiency (capacity to collect money for energy supplied to customers) by 67 per cent. This was higher than the N423billion they collected from their customers between October 2017 and September 2018, when the collection efficiency was 65 per cent. According to the statement, ANED’s director of research and advocacy, Barrister Sunday Oduntan said, “This is a reflection of DisCos’ commitment to reduce losses, even within the context of the financial crisis of the power sector.” Oduntan noted that the DisCos, while increasing their collections by N43billion in a year, by a rate that represents over 10 per cent of improvement, also raised billing efficiency by 5 per cent during the period under review. An analysis of the Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Report the DisCos submitted to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) showed that the DisCos reduced their aggregate technical, commercial and collection (ATC&C) losses by 3.6 per cent within one year – ATC&C was 49 per cent in 2018 and has been reduced to 45 per cent in 2019. The reduction is even more significant, relative to a starting point of 54 per cent, at handover, and within the context of liquidity challenges and lack of access to capital for investment. On the energy delivered to the DisCos, ANED stated that customers were billed for 20,600 gigawatts hour (GWH) of energy from 2017 to 2018, amounting to N650billion, of which N423billion was collected. However, for the period of 2018 through 2019, the DisCos recorded huge improvement in billings – they billed 21,650GWH of energy totalling N693billion, and collected N466billion.
