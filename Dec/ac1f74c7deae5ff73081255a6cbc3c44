A civil society organisation, Shammies Unusual Hearts Foundation, has said that 70 per cent of inmates in Nigeria’s prisons are illegally detained and awaiting trial persons. The executive director of Shamies Foundation, Ms Saratu Abdul, who made this known at the annual lecture series, organised by Shammies Unusual Hearts Foundation in Abuja, lamented that the plight of prisoners and ATP in Nigeria is pitiful. “There is the need to partner with the major stakeholders in the correctional value chain to push for reforms which will in the long run have a positive impact on our nation”. “The condition under which many of them are kept in detention is nothing to write home about, the most worrisome is the illegal detention centers which are springing up all around the country”. According to her, we have come to realise that for us to make impact as an organization, we will focus on the welfare of prisoners and ex-inmates”. She further said that bringing major stakeholders in Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) value chain to a roundtable to deliberate on ways to make crime less attractive, will ensure that inmates and ex-convicts are on the part of sustainable solutions to build a safe and secure society. The controller general of NCS, Mr Ja’afaru Ahmed who was represented by assistant Controller General of corrections ACG, Mr Peter Pevigo, noted that reintegration of inmates was a major challenge of the service. According to him, the public also need to help the service carry out its mandate effectively by accepting the inmates that have finished their jail terms, saying that it would also help decongest the centres across the country.
