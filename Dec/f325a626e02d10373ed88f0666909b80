A group, the Leadership and Dialogue Initiative (LDI) has criticised the processes that could determine the appointment of a new State Coordinator for the International Fund for the Livelihood Improvement Family Enterprises Project -Niger Delta (LIFE-ND). The LIFE-ND, is an IFAD assisted project, with the objective of enhancing income, food security and job creation for rural youth and women through sustainable Agricultural enterprise development. President of the NGO, Prince Chibuike Echem, while speaking to LEADERSHIP on Thursday, however, called on Gov. Ikpeazu to intervene and ensure that due process was followed in the appointment of a coordinator for the Agriculture Development (IFAD), funded project. Echem, who alleged ethnic bias in the selection process, said the interview held between November 3 and 4, had raised a lot of credibility questions and backlash on Ngwa people of the state.
He expressed this view in an interview with Aluta News in Abuja. According to him, “As an eyewitness, I observed with dismay the irregularities that transpired especially in the interview. ”It is indeed a mis-procurement to call candidates that did not apply or were not shortlisted to come and partake in the interview.’’ He said that the project, driven by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), in partnership with IFAD, and had targeted the creation of 38,250 jobs in the agricultural sector. He emphasised that some politicians were colluding with the ministry and had been making moves to alter the results in favour of Onyeizu.
