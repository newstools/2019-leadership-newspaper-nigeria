The Nigeria State Health Program Investment Project (NSHIP) funded by the World Bank, is targeting 2.5m children aged 12-23 months across eight states of the federation for three doses of pentavalent vaccine in 2020, its national project coordinator, Binta Ismail has said. She also said the project would ensure 700,000 deliveries are attended by skilled health personnel. Currently the number of such deliveries is 620,000 from last December, compared to a baseline of nearly 77,000 in 2010. The aim, according to her, is to increase the delivery and use of high impact maternal and child health interventions and improve quality of care at selected health facilities in the participating states. The project,  which is expected to end in six months, spans six states in the north east, alongside Ondo and Nasarawa, reaching 27 million people across more than 2,000 primary and secondary health facilities in 101 local government areas. Mirrored in the Basic Health Care Provision Fund, NSHIP funds go to autonomous facilities “based on performance measured by the quality and quantity of services provided. “They utilise the funds without much interference, and it is co-managed by the facility and community to ensure the facility increases its services around quantity and quality,” explained Ismail. She contended that the impact of the $150 million project has been visible, pointing out that “there have been independent surveys going on. If you compare the outcomes of these surveys with NSHIP states and non-NSHIP, or even look at the trend of analysis from the baseline to where they are in the implementation of the project, you will see visible increase around the indicators that the project is working on.”
