Sambo Marafa, younger brother of Kabir Marafa, ex-senator representing Zamfara central, has resigned his appointment as special adviser to Bello Matawalle, the state governor, on comprehensive agricultural revolution programme. Sambo Marafa said he resigned so he could pay attention to his business. Jamilu Zannah and Bilyaminu Shinkafi, commissioners for higher education and science and technology, respectively, also resigned their positions. Their resignations came barely two weeks after they were inaugurated. Speaking to journalists on Saturday in Gusau, the state capital, Zannah, who was Matawalleâ€™s campaign director during the 2019 governorship election in the state, hinged his resignation on alleged high-handedness and lack of consultation on the part of the governor.
