The minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Umar Farouq  yesterday responded to the outcry against the non- approval of payments of October and November, 2019 stipends to N-Power beneficiaries, promising that they would be paid, even as she insisted that the programme would continue to receive government’s support. She said during a press briefing in Abuja that the N-Power initiative is one of the four clusters of National Social Investment Programmes (NSIP) that were designed to stem the growing tide of poverty, unemployment and social insecurity in Nigeria. She reassured that N-Power is the job creation and economic empowerment component of the NSIP for young unemployed Nigerians and urged beneficiaries and the general public not to be apprehensive with regards the continuity or sustainability of the Social Investment programmes as the government will continue to adequately fund them and ensure that they reached the beneficiaries and touch lives positively. “I have received initial briefings from heads of Agencies and Programmes reporting to the Ministry from October 2019, however on account of the technicalities involved, the handing over process is still on-going,” she said.   With regards, to recent agitations and outcry against the non – approval of payments of October and November, 2019 stipends to N-Power beneficiaries she reaffirmed commitment to ensure that beneficiaries of all the Social Investment Programmes access interventions designed for them within the stipulated guidelines. She added that the Home Grown Feeding Programme, which is also a cluster of the NSIP has continued to run smoothly since its transfer to the ministry, except for the four states that were submitted during her absence adding that this has already been treated. While speaking on the information gaps with regards the monitoring and evaluation mechanism and framework of the N – Power and the GEEP programmes, some officials of NSIP are of the view that the programmes should be completely restructured.
