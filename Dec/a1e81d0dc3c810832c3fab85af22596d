The director general of NILDS , Prof Abubakar Sulaiman stated this when the country director of IMF in Nigeria ,Dr. Lean Martin , paid him a courtesy call in his office in Abuja . According to him , most Nigerians have a negative view of the IMF stressing the need for sensitization to increase awareness of the workings of the financial organization. While lamenting the high turnover of legislators in the National Assembly, Prof Sulaiman said there is a need to train legislators to increase their capacity especially when they engage the executive during oversight functions . He also observed that most of the engagements of the IMF starts and stops with the executive saying the epitome of good governance is the legislature. “ Nigeria is going through serious challenges, there has been stigmatization on the role IMF played in Nigeria in the 80s and we will sensitize Nigerians on the roles of IMF. You can use us as a vehicle to reach out to the parliament, we can do so much in terms of enhancing the capacity of various committees in the legislature,training for staff of NASS,we are collaborating with EU, ECOWAS, UNDP and others, IMF as a global institution should not be left out. He also commended the effort of the IMF for stabilizing Nigeria ‘s economy adding that through the parliament, most of the country‘ a challenges can be solved . On his part,the country director of the IMF said he is looking forward to collaborating and exchange views on economy and legislative agenda.
