The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has said that both the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice had the sum of N5.6 billion inserted in the 2019 budget for the execution of zonal intervention projects. ICPC chairman, Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, revealed this at a media roundtable in Abuja, to promote the ‘My Constituency, My Project’ initiative of the Commission. ICPC spokesperson, Rasheedat Okoduwa said the chairman revealed that a breakdown of the 2019 allocation for zonal interventional projects shows that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) would spend N2.9 billion on constituency projects. Owasanoye added that the allocation of N2.7 billion to the Ministry of Justice in the same budget brings to the fore, some of the anomalies surrounding the implementation of constituency projects across the country. He was concerned that constituency projects, which principally were projects and empowerment programmes designed to bring development to rural communities within the country had been included in the budgets of MFA and other non-relevant ministries and agencies. According to him, “What is constituency project doing in Foreign Affairs? We will ask questions with this kind of allocation.” The ICPC boss further revealed that only about 60 percent of constituency projects have been completed with a lot of them executed in shoddy ways due to poor technical designs, impositions and other sundry irregularities.
