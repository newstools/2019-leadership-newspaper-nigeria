The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has warned intending pilgrims to Israel against criminal activities and absconding to other countries. Minister of state for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, who gave the warning at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja during her farewell visit to the first batch of FCT pilgrims, disclosed that the administration has put in place machinery to apprehend pilgrims who might want to abscond from Israel to other countries. Aliyu added that those intending to use the opportunity for criminal purposes would also not be spared, as they will be made to face the full wrath of the law. “It is my prayer that this pilgrimage will be a unique and unforgettable experience for you all, hoping you return home joyful and strengthened in Faith. I want you to also consider your trip to the Holy Land as a privilege and a special favour from God because many more people had similar plans to travel but have not succeeded as you have done. You should therefore not take this trip for granted but make the best use of all the opportunities it presents.” Represented by the FCT permanent secretary, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, the minister of state also noted that the director, FCT Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board (FCT-CPWB), has done his best to ensure a successful pilgrimage, adding that it’s the responsibility of pilgrims to understand the sensitive nature of the obligation. She reiterated that pilgrims are expected to come back to be sterling examples of Christians in their family, community, places of work and in the country at large, by portraying Christ-like attitudes which will showcase good values of their faith.
