The Niger Delta Coalition for Unity and Progress has disclosed that Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki’s claim that the new board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which was approved by the Senate on 5 November, 2019 was selected by the national chairman of APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole without the knowledge of President Muhammadu Buhari was false. The group said that it is bothered over the politicisation of the appointment of board nominees into the NDDC and how it has been turned into a proxy war of Edo State politics against the very fact of the process that produced the board. A statement made available to LEADERSHIP yesterday in Abuja by the group said that the claims by the Edo State Governor signed by his media aide, published in national newspapers and online media are untrue. The statement reads in part: “For the avoidance of doubt, even the announcement of the board nominees, which was first made on August 27 and then in October when the president sent his letter personally signed by him containing the list of the nominees to the senate, indicates clearly that President Buhari approved the composition of the board.” ‘’To take that personal effort and impugn the reputations of the credible and high-achieving members of that board who have nothing to do with Edo State politics and who were painstakingly headhunted to reposition the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is irresponsible and fraudulent.’’
