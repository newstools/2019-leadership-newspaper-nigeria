Deputy director and researcher at the National Defence College (NDC), Abuja, Dr. Yusuf Abubakar Mamud has given new insights on how to prevent Boko Haram Terrorism and extremism. Mamud put his thoughts in a book – ‘In God’s Name We Fight: Embracing and Renouncing Violent Extremism’ – which he is set to formally launch next week, alongside another book of his on struggles and triumphs of the average Nigeria youth, titled ‘Turning Forty’. According to him, engaging the family and religious leaders by government, security agencies and other stakeholders is key to in ending the scourge of violent extremism like Boko Haram as being experienced in Nigeria. He said  a softer approach to preventing and countering extremism and terrorism, can be implemented successfully using the family and religious leaders, without forgoing the military offensive and counter attacks. Addressing journalists in Abuja at the weekend ahead of the twin book launch, Mamud, who has been a researcher at the NDC for about 20 years, said his lengthy studies and experience prove that the family unit is key to tackling the ignorance which fuels extremism. He explained, “we must start from the family unit in a bid to stem the tide of violent extremism”. This can produce evidence based response. The family is key to tackling violent extremism. Family must be at the heart of the solution.
