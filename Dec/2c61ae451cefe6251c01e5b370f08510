Cross River State governor, Prof Ben Ayade has restated  his administration’s commitment to boosting agriculture in the state through mechanised farming. The governor made the disclosure at the weekend while taking part in the harvesting of rice at his private farm in Obanliku local government area of the state, saying Agro-industrialisation is the only antidote against unemployment in the country. Ayade who described farming as the surest way to poverty alleviation, thanked president Buhari for creating the enabling environment for those interested in going into farming as a full scale profession. His words: “As a professor with very strong background in private business before going into private business and then politics,  President’s Buhari’s policy focus on agriculture was very clear to me and I took advantage of it and kinetically crystallised it to the product of what you see here today, the Ayade farms.   We are encouraging young men and women to go into agriculture and take advantage of the modern agricultural techniques my administration has put in place to enable them enjoy themselves while earning a living.” Ayade said, “Cross River State government has made the whole process easy, from the process of seed cultivation to ensure that we have high yield seeds, we set up the first vitaminised rice seedlings centre in Africa, and to complement it, we have a technical partnership in place with John Deere so we also provide tractorisation and mechanisation support services. “We are also building an ultra-modern rice mill in Ogoja that is about 85 per cent complete.” The governor explained that Cross River state is pioneering Agro- Industrialisation because his administration clearly understood the need for Nigeria to create an economy outside oil. “When President Buhari came into office one of his critical focus was finding and creating a new Nigeria beyond oil, we had to have a roadmap that created a new prosperity agenda for Nigeria beyond oil therefore, because we are an agrarian state with a huge population agro-industrial revolution is the right way to go to create jobs and engage our teeming youths.
