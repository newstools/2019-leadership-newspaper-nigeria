The standard gauge railway line in the Eastern axis of Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) will be launched next year, the Chairman Senate Committee on Land Transport, Senator, Abdulfatai Buhari, has said. According to him the eastern line linking Port-Harcourt, Gombe and Maiduguri will be launched as soon Ibadan to Kano standard gauge is flagged off. Buhari who made known at Abeokuta after the inspection of the ongoing construction of Lagos to Ibadan standard gauge railway line by joint committee on land transport was quite optimistic that the project will be completed by April next year. He also disclosed that the decision to link the seaport by rail was aimed at ensuring that bulky goods are evacuated from the seaport to the hinterland adding that evacuation of bulky goods by rail will reduce current gridlock experienced at Apapa. According to him, it will also help to increase the lifespan of our roads which are always damaged by heavy duty trucks. The chairman noted that plans are underway to link the airport by rail adding that all over the world the rail mode provides alternative to the road and water transport and Nigeria should not be an exception. Chairman House Committee on Land Transport , Hon Tajudeen Abbas commended China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) over the pace of work on the Lagos to Ibadan standard gauge railway line. He also expressed satisfaction over the ongoing construction of railway stations between Lagos and Ibadan.
