The Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside has called on Nigerians not to lose sight of the significance of Christmas. He stated that Christians must continually understand why God sent Jesus Christ to the world to redeem mankind and pave way for salvation. Peterside, who stated this in his Christmas message made available to LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, explained that the reason for the season is to enable Christians appreciate the circumstances that surrounded the birth of Jesus Christ and the need to appreciate love for one another. He said: “Beyond the issue of celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ is the need for Christians to deepen their knowledge and understanding of God’s love for mankind. “Whilst we make merry and give out gift items, we must also show love to one other and avoid situations that tend to divide us as a people. “Despite the challenges we have faced as a nation, this period offers us the opportunity to show love to one another and live peacefully.” The NIMASA boss tasked Nigerians to support the President Muhamnadu Buhari-led administration, who he says is working hard to bequeath a better nation. While arguing that not everybody will agree with the president on all issues, Peterside said no one is in doubt as to his determination to leave behind enduring legacies. He said: “President Buhari and his vice, Professor Yemi Osinbajo have shown love for this country and it is evident in the way and manner they have been progressing. We can only support them to our benefit. “I appeal to Nigerians across board to pray for them in the spirit of the season, show love to our neighbours and live peacefully amongst ourselves.”
