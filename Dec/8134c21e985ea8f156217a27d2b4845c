The Financial Report Council of Nigeria (FRC) has called on the federal government to as a matter of urgency intervene, fast track and possibly recover its landed property located at Guzape of the federal capital territory. The executive secretary, FRC, Daniel Asapokhai, said this during the Council’s visit to the FCT minister, Muhammed Bello. He stated that the body had not been able to carry out any meaningful development on the disputed landed property due to the activities of squatters. He said unlike many of the federal government agencies, the Council operates primarily from Lagos.  “So I am sure some of you that have been in Abuja for a while will be familiar with the corporate affairs commission, the investment promotion council, and a number of other agencies within our ministry,” he said. “But when you mention financial reporting council perhaps no one has heard about it, because, you can’t pinpoint where it operates from and that is because we have no office in Abuja.” According to him, “There is a matter we have been pursuing for a long time. We had petitioned the federal government over the issue of allocating us a property here in Abuja. We got the approval in 2015 for us to get a landed property in Abuja so we can build our headquarters. “That approval coincided with the time government approved for Nigeria to adopt international financial reporting standard (IFRS) and for the public sector to use the International Public Sector Accounting Standard (IPSAS). “Your ministry allocated to us a piece of landed property of about 10,000sq metres in guzape. Unfortunately, since 2015 that we received our certificate of occupancy, we have not been able to develop the place due to some legacy issues.” Asapokhai said the council is a regulatory agency of the federal government under the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment.
