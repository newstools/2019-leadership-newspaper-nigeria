A government approved training institute for Cosmetology and Beauty Therapy, Kings and Queens Beauty Institute (KQBI) has commenced empowerment training for over 30 girls from Karimajiji and Kuchingoro communities of Abuja. The aim is to secure the future of girl child, the institute said in a statement. Speaking during the training session yesterday in Abuja, Director of the Institute, Susie Aghedo said the gesture was envisioned to take the girl child out of the street and secure a future for them through profitable training that will provide a means of livelihood to them. “Most of the girls that are been trafficked today are as a result of the fact that they have nothing to do, some are been dropped out of school, so when the traffickers come with all manners of enticement they easily fall into the trap, but the reverse is the case when they are profitably engaged,” Aghedo said. Aghedo said that the training is a way of given back to the society. “As the saying goes, when you train a girl you train the community. That it more like train the trainer, its expected that these 30 girls will inturn train others in the community.” Also speaking, the Registrar, Kings and Queens Beauty Institute, Toritse Ikomi said that the institute also offers Diploma certificate in cosmetology and beauty therapy to equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge for a career in the salon and beauty industry, taking students through all departments in hairdressing, beauty therapy, nail technology, make-up to blend academic learning with hands on practical experience . He said that the girls were selected based on the recommendation of their kingsmen and not by the institute. Ikomi encouraged them to be serious with the training so that they will continue the chain – to train others upon their completion, adding that “by 2020 we intends to extend same to other communities.”
