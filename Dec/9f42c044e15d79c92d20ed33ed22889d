The Kogi State government has assured residents and commuters of their safety in the state during the Yuletide, insisting that measures are in place to ensure security of all. In a statement in Lokoja at the weekend, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information and Communications Strategy, Kingsley Fanwo said that  the state government will not soft pedal in its decision to ensure security of lives and property. He noted, “We urge our people to be rest assured that adequate measures are in place to protect them wherever they are. Commuters have nothing to fear, traversing the state as our Operation Total Freedom is capable of maintaining our momentum against criminal elements. “The few flashes of attacks witnessed some weeks ago were traced to criminals who entered the state to foment trouble. We have tightened the noose on them and it will be difficult for them to disturb the peace of the state anymore”. “The government of Kogi State will continue to put security on the front burner in order to retain the confidence of investors to see Kogi State as investment destination”. Fanwo said that the state has remained “on top of the security game due to the periodic review of its performance in order to permanently close the door against criminality in the state”, assuring the people that the development witnessed in the state was largely as a result of the “uncompromising position of the GYB’s administration on security matters”. “The governor, state security adviser, security agents and the people of the state are on top of the security game in the state. We are all on the same page as far as fighting crime is concerned. It’s unimaginable the level of technology the state government has put in place to power its ‘Techno-Crime Combat Initiative’. The model adopted in Kogi state has been effective and assuring.”
