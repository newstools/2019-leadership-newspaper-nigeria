Amidst the festivities of this season, First Bank Nigeria Limited at the weekend brought together, thousands of young Nigerians to enlighten them and stir up the spirit of entrepreneurship at the third edition of the First Bank Youth Empowerment Summit. Speaking at the summit, chairman of the board of the bank, Mrs Ibukun Awosika noted that the bank through the summit is contributing its own quota to the building of the economic future of the country. “Firstbank is a nation builder and any institution that wants to contribute to nation building cannot avoid investing in building and enlightening the next generation of Nigerians,” Awosika said. “So essentially what we are doing is equipping the next generation as a seed of nation building.” Awosika who spoke extensively on entrepreneurship, said, “We definitely need to build a whole generation of entrepreneurs and it is our ability to engage multitude of young people that we are taking through schools. We need to create jobs and we need to create an enterprise mindset so they can be solution providers and business builders. “We need to build businesses that create jobs because government cannot create jobs. They can employ some people to the civil service but the bulk of the population will still remain in the private sector and you only do that by creating enterprise.” Awosika, who is the founder of The Chair Centre, Lekki, said the most successful way to educate is to empower and to reset the minds of the young people and part of that is discussing about not looking for quick money processes but to focus on character, integrity and mindset and building a business that require some level of patience.
