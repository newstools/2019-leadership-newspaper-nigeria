by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS). Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), the police and the military under the supervision of the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA). The exercise is entirely meant to check the smuggling of goods and arms into the country. However, some of the prices of the food items that come from the land borders, especially the Republic of Benin such as rice, turkey and oil, have increased astronomically. However, the price rice, which rose astronomically in the wake of the border closure, is gradually reducing as local millers increase their production. FCT Residents Pay Less For Food Items
Among Nigerians, who enjoy low food prices are residents of the Federal capital territory (FCT) as checks by LEADERSHIP Weekend revealed that the prices of rice, beans, millet, maize, wheat, tomatoes, and pepper, have dropped.

However, the price of 25 litres of palm oil has increased from between N6,500 and N7, 000 to between N12,600 and N12,500.
A 50kg bag of onions also increased from N30,000 a month ago to N35,000. Speaking to LEADERSHIP Weekend, a dealer Abdullahi Usman, attributed the prices to the high supply of food items usually experienced during harvest season in the state. “We are happy that the prices of food items have crashed, and you can see from the buyers that they are not complaining. It is harvest time, so the prices of food items are falling on daily basis as new ones from the farms flood the market,” he said. Another trader, Ngozi Martins, also attributed the crash in the prices of vegetables to the season, adding that the price of onions increased because it is going out of season. “It is normal for onions to increase during this period, while the prices of other food items except rice have dropped,” she said. Ngozi, however, speculated the possibility of increase in the prices of food items in the next few weeks, when residents begin shopping for Christmas and salaries are paid. A consumer, Fatima Usman, expressed joy over the development and prayed that it remained so throughout the Christmas season. “We are happy with the current prices of food items. The borders should remain closed if the prices of food items can witness this drop. This is a good development, particularly that there is no money for people like us to spend. So, we need employment and more loans to facilitate our business,” she said. Commenting on the prices of food items, Banke Odeyemi, said that the traders would not take advantage of the festive season to increase the prices. Rice Price Hits Rooftop In Cross River
The situation is however different in Cross River State. At Watt Market, Calabar, the state capital that a cup of rice sold for N90 before the closure of the borders. But now, it sells for between N120 and N130, and as the Yuletide season approaches, a cup of rice sells for N120. It was also discovered that before the border closure, a 50kg bag of beans sold for N20,000 but now goes for N22,000.
Also, before the closure of the borders, a cup of beans sold for N50, notwithstanding the fact that a 50kilogramme of beans sold for N20,000.
As the Yuletide approaches, a bag of beans (50kilogrammes) sells for N22,000 is retailed at N60 per cup. However, palm oil which sold for N10,000 for 25 litres before the closure of borders dropped to N8,000. The Yuletide season has little effect on the price of the commodity as it returned back to N10,000 for 25 litres. Again, a basket of tomatoes which used to sell for N7,000 still remained at the same price. A packet of Maggi cube has risen from N400 to N420.
Before now, groundnut oil sold for N6,300 for 20 litres (the white rubber) but with the Yuletide season in view, it has increased to N8,000. This is not to say that all the brands of groundnut oil sell for N8,000. The 25 litres of Tonimas container sells for N14,000 and a bottle of beer depending on the brand goes for N400. Consumer products such as curry did not witness any price increment as a roll of it which contains 10 sachets still sells for N90.

The traders called on the government to repair roads, which according to them, are responsible for low turnover. Another issue which the traders also called on the government to address is taxation and extortion by touts parading themselves as tax agents.
One of the trader said: “Can you imagine that from the take-off point where we purchase the goods at the local markets, some young boys used to collect money from us under the pretence that they are tax agents. “Immediately we get to Watt Market, Calabar, another group of boys would prevent us from evacuating our goods from the vehicles that brought us from the bush market, unless we pay a mandatory N1,000. “Besides, the gatemen at the market also collect gate fees from us, otherwise your goods will remain there, especially if it is at night you might end up exposing yourself to danger,” she said. Price Remains Stable In Jigawa
In Jigawa State, the price of food items have remained stable, despite the approaching Christmas and New Year celebrations.

Wheat costs N600 as against N400 before now. There is, however, an increase in the prices of tubers.

The same thing applies to a small basket of Irish potato which used to be less than N700, it is now sold for between N1,400 and N1,700. Price Fluctuates In Kebbi
As Christmas draws closer, prices of foodstuff in Kebbi State are fluctuating with the major foodstuff like rice and maize witnessing a slight increase in their prices, while the prices of livestock remain stable. A market survey conducted in Birnin Kebbi, the Kebbi State capital and neighbouring markets, indicates that rice, which is the major food item consumed and cultivated in Kebbi State, is witnessing an increase in price because of the increase in patronage. A grain seller at Kara Market, Malan Bello Sahabi, said a bag of rice which used to be N14,000 is now N17,000, a bag of millet which used to be sold at N9,000 is now N12,000, while a bag of beans is now sold between N13,000 to 14,000, a slight decrease from what it used to be N15,000. At the Vegetable Market, a basket of tomatoes and pepper is sold at N5000 and N6000 respectively, unlike before when it was sold at N10,000 and N12,000. Onion too has risen from N15,000 toN19,000 per bag. Border Closure, Not Yuletide Behind Food Price Increase In Sokoto
Locals in Sokoto, as well as businesswomen in the markets visited by LEADERSHIP Weekend, have confirmed that the state is experiencing a rise in prices of foodstuff not necessarily because of the yuletide season but closure of land borders. The testimonies from those who came to buy foodstuff in the markets visited were not any different. A measure of millet is sold for N280, beans N350, maize N300, while local rice goes for N700. According to Mrs Elizabeth Eze, though, prices of foodstuff usually go up in other parts of the country, especially in the December period, but not in Sokoto as the majority of the people are Muslims. She pathetically added that, the scenario seems changed this year as nearly every foodstuff has gone up even before the Yuletide season.
In her view of the market trend, she said, a bag of rice which used to be sold between N12,500 and 13,000 before the border closure, has gone as high as N17,500 and above even in Sokoto where they used to buy smuggled rice at cheaper prices. “You see, everything has gone up. We now buy rice for as high as N17,500. We buy 25kg of vegetable oil for between N13,500 and N14,000. But before the border closure, we bought these items very cheap.” Confirming her position, a marketer in the popular Sokoto food and vegetable market who preferred not to be mentioned said, it is not their fault that they are selling at a higher rate, because they now buy at higher rates as well. “Let’s tell ourselves some blunt reality, go around the entire market and come back to tell me how many of the bags of parboiled rice you see are local ones? We do not have enough of the local rice. And more so, people still prefer imported ones because it is 90 percent stone-free, unlike our local rice. “Because of that, those who smuggle this rice now either go through long routes to avoid been caught by security agencies or bribe their way to bring in the goods. And do not forget, they equally add up all that to the price hence we are buying at a higher cost and have no option than to sell with little gain,” she said. At the Kara Livestock segment of the market, some of the owners of herds of cattle told Leadership that the border restriction is equally affecting their business.
They noted with pains that, some of their members who go as far as Niger Republic and Chad to buy livestock at cheaper rates cannot try that now, hence the principle of higher demand the higher price sets in. Prices Of Food In Ibadan Go Up
At the popular Bodija market, the prices of food items such as rice, beans, vegetable oil, palm oil, yam, and other ingredients, have increased.
The price of rice is now between N24,000 and N18,000. The Cotonou rice is sold for N24,000 while the local rice popularly called Nigerian rice is sold from N20,000 to N18,000. The price of beans, though it has come down when compared to the period there was insurgency in the north yet, the price is still high.
Though the beans are of different types, the prices are different, depending on the customer’s choice.
The bags are sold between N30,000 and N20,000 depending on the type. The prices of vegetable oil and palm oil were not stable because the traders believe it is festive period.
A vegetable trader, Mrs. Olusola Adigun said that their expectation was that prices would not go up until a few days to the celebration.
She said though prices of things are not stable, it is expected that the price will go up a few days to the festival. According to her, there has not been much patronage by customers since the festival is about two weeks to this time. Speaking on the cost of rice which is a household name, a trader, Alhaja Abosede Tijani, attributed it to the border closure and high cost of transportation.
While noting that there were types of rice, she said the prices were not beyond the reach of average Nigerians. The trader, who claimed that the border closure had brought untold hardship on the people, called on the government to revisit the issue.
However, she said with the local rice, Nigerians have alternative stable food for the celebration. ..Prices Rise In Enugu
As the Yuletide season draws nearer, food prices have increased in markets located in Enugu State.
Our investigations revealed that the prices of items like rice, tomatoes and other items have increased, a development that is making it difficult for people to purchase the items. Although many are attributing the increment to the closure of Nigeria borders, others believe that the hike was occasioned by the forthcoming Christmas celebrations. It was gathered that a bag of foreign rice which was sold at N18,000 naira is now sold at N25,000 now. LEADERSHIP Weekend further gathered that a bag of local rice is now sold at N18,000 while a paint of tomatoes is now sold at between N600 and N800.
It was further learnt that the price of frozen food has increased tremendously. Our investigations revealed that it is now difficult to purchase a chicken for N2,000. Speaking with our correspondent in Enugu, a food seller who identified herself as Mama Nneoma said the increment in the prices of food items was biting hard on them, and expressed fear that the prices may increase further before December 25 this year. “We are afraid that the prices may increase before December 25 this year, the prices of food items have continued to increase despite non-availability of money,” she stated.
