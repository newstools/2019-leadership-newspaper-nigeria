Bauchi State governor, Senator Bala Mohammed has dismissed any conflict, quarrel or rancour with Gombe State government over the ownership of an oil well discovered recently in boundary communities of the state. Recall that the Gombe State government had recently raised an alarm, claiming that the boundary communities, where an oil well was discovered in Bauchi State actually belonged to Gombe State. Speaking with newsmen after a courtesy visit to the FCT minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello in Abuja, the governor stated that there won’t be any quarrel or conflict between Bauchi and Gombe States over the ownership of the oil well. “The oil well is for God’s glory and for the benefit of Bauchi and Gombe States. Anything on the border communities is for both sides. We are brothers and sisters and we have lived together from time immemorial. So, anybody talking about division and rancour is just a figment of imagination.” The governor explained that his visit to the FCT minister was to congratulate him for his good work and to appreciate his dynamism in terms of his continuity and humility. He commended the FCT minister for completing the project he inherited from his predecessors and even adding more glamour to them.
