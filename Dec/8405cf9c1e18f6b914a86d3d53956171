Former Zamfara State governor, Abdulaziz Yari, has disclosed that he will not comment on any issue in the state now for reasons best known to him. He spoke to some reporters in Daura, Katsina after a visit to President Muhammadu Buhari’s country home. LEADERSHIP recalls that  Yari had written his successor, Bello Matawalle, over the non-payment of his outstanding monthly allowance and pension. In a letter dated October 17, 2019, Yari addressed the incumbent state governor, informing him that he (Yari) is entitled to N10 million monthly as upkeep allowance, but that he has only been paid twice since he left the office. However, in a swift reaction, Zamfara House of Assembly had repealed the law mandating the state government to pay pension and other entitlements of former governors and deputies, as well as those of Speakers and their deputies. However, Yari said the time is not ripe for him to speak and he will allow the people of the state to judge. He said, “Sincerely speaking, I said I will not talk about Zamfara in any media, because of  the situation, and it  is not timely, but I will allow people to judge.” On the charge by President Buhari to governors elected on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) not to allow the party die after 2023, Yari expressed confidence that another APC candidate will succeed the president in 2023. “Mr president is right, success without a successor is a failure, maybe that is what he wants to translate, we are going to support him as we started since 2002 with the struggle. Now that he has the mantle of leadership, we will continue to support him and the good job he is doing with his deputy, to put the country in the right direction. We believe very strongly that APC will succeed President Buhari come 2023,” he added.
