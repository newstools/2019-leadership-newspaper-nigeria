Some prominent citizens of Kano State have filed a fresh action before the Kano State High Court challenging the creation of additional emirates in the state by the state government. The suit is seeking, among other reliefs, an order setting aside the recently passed Kano State Emirates Council Law, 2019. The plaintiffs in the new suit include Bashir Othman Tofa, Rt Hon Ghali Umar Naâ€™Abba, Prof Awwal Hamisu Yadudu, Alhaji Abdulrahman Dikko; Alhaji Abba Dabo, Prof. Jibrin Ibrahim, Ibrahim Ado Kurawa and 13 others. They are suing Kano State governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, the House, the Attorney General, the Emir of Kano, Kano Emirate and the four new and purportedly appointed emirs. The suit was filed on Friday, 13 December, 2019 with Suit No. K/517/2019 and assigned to High Court 1 presided over by the Chief Judge of Kano State. The law was passed and assented to during the pendency of other proceedings instituted by the Kingmakers in suit No. K/197/2019 which challenged the powers of the government to create additional emirates. This according to them was clearly disrespectful of the judicial process. The plaintiffs also contended that the acts of the defendants have violated the preservation of their cultural rights protected and guaranteed under the Constitution and the African Charter. The Chief Judge in his ruling ordered that the process filed by the prominent citizens of Kano State be served by substituted means and adjourned the matter to the 8 January, 2020 for the hearing of the Motion on Notice.
