As the country prepares for Year 2020, the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has announced a three-day prayer and fasting from January 1 to January 3 for the unity, peace and progress of the country. In a statement signed by NYCN president, Comrade Solomon Adodo, he said that the youths and other well-meaning Nigerians will use the period to seek divine intervention in the affairs of the country. He said that they would also use the exercise to turn away from all misdeeds to secure the hand of God on every national issue. Adodo said: “The National Youth Council of Nigeria herein calls on all Nigerian youths (and indeed every Nigerian) to humbly, sincerely, soberly and solemnly seek the face of God in utter repentance as we embark on three days of prayers and fasting. “It is a known fact that Nigeria has been a highly religious nation across faith lines and denominations. However, we have all been significantly steeped in hypocrisy as a people, rarely practicing what we preach. It is, therefore, time to turn away from all our misdeeds and truly seek God’s face. “All nations that have truthfully sought the face of God while working at their developmental goals have been able to achieve very significant progress. We strongly believe that Nigeria’s myriad of problems can be addressed if we sincerely seek the help of God while assiduously working to address same. “It is on this note that NYCN calls on all Nigerians to embark on these sessions of fasting and prayers to seek God’s guidance in all our national affairs in the year 2020.” Adodo said. During the fast, Christians are expected to converge in their churches while Muslims in mosques within their areas of residence to pray together and break the fast.
