Markets in Ikare like Osele, Okore, Oja Oba and Jubilee have continued to witness high patronage of people to buy foodstuffs, wears and chickens. Our correspondent who monitored the christmas and yuletide mood in Akokoland noted that there was rapid human and vehicular movements around Olukare palace, post office, central mosque area around Terere Cinema due to rush to buy goods for Xmas and new year celebrations. There is also high demand for foodstuffs particularly yam because of high cost rice. A customer who came to Ikare for christmas shopping, Mrs. Ikmat Areje, lamented high cost of rice and hence the purchase of yam. Another respondent, Chief Mrs Risikat Mohamed the Iyalaje of Ikare  attributed the rush to buy goods to importance attached to christmas. She cautioned market women not to hike price of goods because of high demands as the nation’s economy was affecting consumers.
