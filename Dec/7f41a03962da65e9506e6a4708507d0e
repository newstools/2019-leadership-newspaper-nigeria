The executive secretary, Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD), Dr Chioma Ejikeme yesterday said Nigeria’s development foundation was laid by the pensioners who had worked tirelessly in their youthful age to bring the nation together. Ejikeme stated this while playing host to management team of LEADERSHIP Newspaper Group. She said PTAD was a model organisation for the delivery of innovative and sustainable pension services, through competent and dedicated workforce. “I am previleged to be in PTAD, I have learnt a lot from my staff and I look forward to better days.
“The fact that government cares about people who put in their youthful years goes a long way in reinforcing the good intentions of President Muhmadu Buhari led administration on pensioners welfare,” she said. Ejikeme explained that the public sector has been the engine room of development in the country, adding that pensioners have been at the centre stage.
She also noted that introduction of Single Treasury Account has prevented pensioners’ benefits from being diverted into any commercial bank. She informed the team that PTAD pensioners are paid directly from TSA account with CBN, noting that PTAD does not operate an account with any commercial bank. The executive director, Operations, of LEADERSHIP Newspapers, Mr Rasheed Yusuf, in his response, commended the leadership of PTAD for their commitment towards ensuring quality service delivery to pensioners.
He solicited for synergy where relevant information regarding the activities of the organisation can be given quality publicity.
