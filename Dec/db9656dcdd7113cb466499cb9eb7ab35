The Union of Beninese Residents in Nigeria (UBEN) has sought Nigerian government’s collaboration for artisan training for youths from both countries. The union made this known in Abuja yesterday, during the official investiture of its new president. In his investiture speech, the new president, Honore Hounkpatin, expressed the union’s hope to partnering with both federal and state government in setting up centres to train interested youth in different areas of specialisation. He identified such areas of artisanship to include building and the art of putting finishing touches to masons, Plaster of Paris (POP), tillers, tailoring, chef, domestic workers and others. According to him, “Beninese can share experience and ideas for interested candidates in this field of artisan because the field is wide and the market is big, we the Beninese alone cannot do it. There is need for us to partner with Nigeria and most especially, state governments in the country.” Hounkpatin, who recalled that he had trained 400 Nigerians in various artisan works in the last 28 years, said that upon receiving necessary experience, the trained artisans would be encouraged to set up centres where they would be able to train others. He stated that Beninese living in Nigeria now have well-structured union where people could report any misdemeanor committed by members form prompt action while urging them to regularise their stay in Nigeria to avoid conflict with the law.
