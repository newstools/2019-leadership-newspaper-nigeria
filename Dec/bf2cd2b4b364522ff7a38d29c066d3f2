The United States consul general, Claire Pierangelo has canvassed the full inclusion of people with disabilities into all social, political, economic and cultural spheres in Nigeria. Speaking at the closing ceremony of a two-day hackathon titled, “The Future is Accessible,” organised by the US Consulate General Lagos to commemorate the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Pierangelo said that one of the ways the United States promotes the full integration of the disabled is by encouraging and assisting civil society organisations (CSO) around the world, and as such the state’s necessity to also foster and sponsor innovative solutions for persons with disabilities. According to her, technology is very important to persons with disabilities to maximise their potentials and explore their opportunities. “It’s very important for them to be inclusive in our policies and processes and we are proud to support great ideas for tech enthusiasts,” she added. The two-day hackathon competition which was organised in collaboration with Project Enable Africa saw Prisca Onuegbu led team of the Autism Awareness Foundation win $1000 for the most innovative solution with their project, “Thera Connect” where they created an App that addresses difficulties in getting therapist to look after children with autism and other special needs.
