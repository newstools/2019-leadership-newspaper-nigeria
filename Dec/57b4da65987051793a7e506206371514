Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, has urged Nigerians to brace up for the challenges associated with current realities in the country, saying President Muhammadu Buhari  has set Nigeria on a most defining, aspirational journey. Fashola said, President Buhari, by kick-starting a process that would lift 100 million people out of poverty in the country in ten years, was leading the country in an audacious journey. The minister who spoke at the investiture of the president, Nigerian Institute of Building (NIOB), Bldr. Kunle Awobodu as the 20th president of the institute noted that leadership remains a huge task that demands huge commitments and deserves huge sacrifices. Fashola said, “I wish it to be understood clearly that President Buhari has set Nigeria on a most defining, aspirational and audacious journey of a generation by asking us to help him lift a 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years, a period that will run well beyond his tenure.’’ He pointed out that all Nigerians have a role to play by conscientiously building structures of prosperity that will fill up the voids of inequality. Fashola explained that his ministry placed special attention on the capacity of the building efforts to create seasonal jobs, especially with respects to artisanal jobs. He said,” It was found that each unit of house (excluding estate infrastructure works of roads and drains as well as borehole and reticulation systems) produces between 40 to 60 jobs when measured from start to finish. By simple computation therefore, the already completed 2584 housing units alone has provided an amazing 129,200 jobs. ‘’The capacity of the construction sector to create jobs is equally very visible in roads and highway development. Hordes of artisans, technicians and semi-skilled workers are invariably absorbed into different aspects of civil works targeted at construction, maintenance and rehabilitation of roads.
