The applicants prayed the court for an order “abridging the time for which the respondents may enter appearance and file their respective counter affidavits and written addresses to the originating summons within seven days given the time sensitive nature of the suit.’ Also they prayed for the court for an “interim injunction restraining the first respondents from adopting the direct primaries procedure for the conduct of the party’s primary election for the 2019 Bayelsa state governorship election pending the hearing and determination of the originating summons m”. While granting the order in its entirety, the presiding judge, Hon Justice E G Umukoro ordered that the enrolled order of the court be served along with hearing notice to the respondents within 48 hours. Meanwhile, the NWC has shifted the date for the Bayelsa governorship primary from Thursday, August 29 to Saturday, August 31, 2019. The party has also adopted the direct mode of primary, which according to them is in line with the written request of the Bayelsa State chapter and majority of the stakeholders. “This is in compliance with the decision of the APC National Executive Committee (NEC), which grants state chapters and majority of party leaders in a state the right to decide on the mode of primary they wish to adopt,” the party said.
