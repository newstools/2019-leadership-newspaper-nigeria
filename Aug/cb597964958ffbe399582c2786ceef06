The United State embassy in Abuja has denied reports that the US government has placed a Visa restriction on the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), prof Mahmood Yakubu and some commissioners of the electoral body. A source at the embassy who didn’t want to be mentioned told our reporter that that news is false as none of such directive has been given. The source said “the US government refuses to be drawn into any attempt to malign the INEC over the 2019 elections as issues arising from the election are still in court.” The source also confirmed that quite a number of INEC ‘s Commissioners were recently granted Visas to the US, including Amina Zakary
