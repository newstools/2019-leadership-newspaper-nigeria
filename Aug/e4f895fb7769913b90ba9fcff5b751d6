This competition thought me to be very competitive and I want to put that “ginger “ in my life and businesses. But instead am faced with this questions about Khafi “And this is needed to be cleared. Many misunderstandings , misinterpretations, to the point of publications coming from the UK and all, all types of meme and all, it’s a price to pay for Fame yes, but WE especially Khafi doesn’t deserve this. “Am not saying this to Capture any type of relevance, but doing this all for Khafi , because she will do the same and even more.
