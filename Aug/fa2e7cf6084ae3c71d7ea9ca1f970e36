Olanrewaju, mother of three was allegedly raped to death at Olorunda area of Ekiti state capital by a tenant and commercial motorcyclist. The man, who was a tenant to the deceased was said to have fled after allegedly committing the heinous act. A source close to the area, who craved anonymity, disclosed that the woman was said to have been raped around 11am when her husband had gone to work and children were away at a coaching centre. The corpse of the woman according to the source was seen in the room while her two hands were tied by the assailant before she was forcefully raped. “Her two hands were bound while her pant was down which confirmed that she was raped”. The source also fingered the fleeing tenant as being allegedly responsible for the murder. The Ekiti State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Caleb Ikechukwu, who spoke to journalists on the development said the suspect after raping the woman, also strangled her to death. Ikechukwu said that medical examination conducted on the deceased at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital (EKSUTH) confirmed that she was raped before being strangled to death by her assailant. “Medical examination confirmed the above but we have not been able to ascertain who actually committed the crime and what actually led to that. “Apart from this, we saw condom and semen within the scene where the crime was committed which also substantiated the fact she was actually raped. “We were told that a man, who was a neighbour actually did it and fled. We are yet to arrest the man but proper security arrangements have been made that would ensure speedy arrest of the suspect”. The Police spokesman added that the deceased’s husband had deposited the corpse at EKSUTH morgue while investigation is ongoing on the matter.
