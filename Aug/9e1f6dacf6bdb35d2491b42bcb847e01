The FCT Coordinator of the NYSC, Walida Siddique Isa, has assured that the security and welfare of corps members in the camp is of utmost priority and urged them to be law abiding and maintain the NYSC dress code at all times. Speaking at the swearing in ceremony of the Orientation course for the 2019 Batch ‘B’ Stream 2 corps members yesterday in Kubwa, Abuja. She warned that NYSC rules of engagement are sacrosanct, while all camp activities are mandatory. Walida Isa said, “I charge you therefore to follow its trend with passion for your physical fitness, mental alertness and entrepreneurship dispositions. I must warn again that your NYSC uniform is a National symbol that must not be tampered with except for obvious reasons of oversized and or undersized. While I confirm that your security and welfare is guaranteed.” Similarly, the minister FCT, Alhaji Muhammad Musa Bello assured corps members that their orientation programme will not only be exciting but will definitely impact positively on their physical fitness and mental alertness. The minister, who was represented by the Director, Finance and Administration FCTA, Mr. Udo Samuel Atang stated that the programme will assuage the objectivity of corps members in line with the reality of Nigeria’s diversities, and above all, expose them to skills quite critical to integrity, prosperity and self-sufficiency. Bello said, “I charge you not to toy with the SAED programme, rather you must consider the lectures and the hands on trainings both as a certificate, and a live changing course, and give it all the necessary attention it deserves. The FCTA will continue to give the NYSC scheme in the FCT all the necessary support it deserves at all times and at all levels. Accordingly, I urge the NYSC FCT Coordinator not to hesitate in presenting its challenges and calling for those critical concerns from time to time”.
