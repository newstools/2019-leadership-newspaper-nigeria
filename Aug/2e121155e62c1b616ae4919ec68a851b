Two non-governmental organisations, Connected Development (CODE) and ONE Campaign, alongside over 50 of the World’s leading NGOs, have petitioned the G7 leaders to accelerate action on gender equality. The G7 Summit will be holding Saturday, August 24, in Biarritz, France. The petition, which was coordinated by the ONE Campaign and co-signed by Connected Development [CODE] and other NGOs, warned that despite promises to do more for women and girls, the world is dangerously off-track on gender equality. At a moment when the future of multilateralism is in doubt, this year’s G7 summit presents an unprecedented opportunity for leaders to show they can make a difference. Reducing inequality is the central theme of this year’s summit and yet gender inequality remains one of the most pervasive barriers to growth and prosperity. According to CODE’s Chief Executive, Hamzat Lawal, the G7 leaders have an unprecedented opportunity to begin to turn the tide against gender inequality by fast-tracking the delivery of long-lasting change for girls and women across the world, including Sub-Saharan Africa. Lawal added that inequality hinders the possibility to deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, especially in Nigeria, and urges the World Leaders to support new laws, policies and funding that will help to advance women’s rights and economic empowerment. “It is beyond belief that we will have to wait another 108 years to achieve gender equality across the world. Until this changes, leaders are ignoring the power and potential of half the world’s population,” Gayle Smith, President of ONE said. The petition calls on the leaders attending the summit to take real action and agree to independent reporting of their commitments when they meet in Biarritz. The G7 Summit will involve the leaders of the African Union, the IMF, the OECD, the UN and the World Bank.
