The newly appointed group managing director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr Mele Kyari, yesterday said crude oil pricing and volume of production are key factors in ensuring sustainable revenue generation for the country. Kyari said this in Vienna, while addressing journalists on the sidelines of the 176th Meeting of the OPEC Conference. The new NNPC boss, who is Nigeria’s OPEC National Representative was represented at the meeting by Mr. Bala Wunti. Furthermore, Kyari assured the global audience that Nigeria would continue to support the declaration of cooperation that has helped in restoring stability in the global oil market. “Through the Declaration of Cooperation, greater stability is restored globally,  Nigeria believes that having the right price and volume can support our aspiration and ensure  a sustainable revenue generation,” he said. According to Kyari, a continuation of the declaration was the way to go.  He said a six-month extension was too short a time and would not have the required impact in curbing uncertainty and volatility which existed before the cooperation “So a nine-month extension is the way to go considering the objective of the declaration, that is why Nigeria supports the initiative and is also  grateful that big nations are committed to it,” Kyari said He further expressed the commitment of the NNPC in revamping refineries, noting that in-country refining of crude through multiple channels and collaboration would ensure the nation becomes a major petroleum product exporter by 2020.
