He promised that the company will proactively begin to prepare to raise fund for increase of its Issued Share Capital. This, he said, was in addition to its plan for the acquisition of a life company. The company’s managing director/CEO, Mr. Tope Smart, said that despite the difficult operating environment, his company maintained its focus as it continued to increase its market share. From about five per cent market share, he added that the company now controls close to seven per cent market share of non-life business, promising to continually improve on this figure. “Our associate in Ghana Regency NEM Insurance is expanding its operations into the major areas in Ghana. This will lead to more income for the company and ultimately impact its bottom line in the nearest future,” he pointed out. With a strong reputation built over the years, coupled with a very strong brand in the insurance industry and robust financials, he said, the future of the company looks very exciting, promising to take advantage of the opportunities to take the company to the next level.
