In addition, Fagbemi said the company is also working towards diversifying its operations so as it achieve its targets of higher revenue. “One of the things we are looking at is that our business, if you take mainland cargo option for example, we are a logistics company and one of the first things that happen when I came is that since logistics is not just about the air, it is also about land and sea, our focus now is how do we diversify our business to begin to look at the other mode of transportation. Aviation is just a part of the transport system,” she added.
