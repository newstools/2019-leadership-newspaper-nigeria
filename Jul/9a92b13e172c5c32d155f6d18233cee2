While presenting the accused persons, the prosecution counsel, Simon Harrison Ibekwute, informed the court of the plea bargain agreement proposed by their respective lawyers and agreed to by the Commission. He then prayed the court to accept same as he invited the defendants to take their plea one after the other. They all pleaded guilty to their respective charges.
