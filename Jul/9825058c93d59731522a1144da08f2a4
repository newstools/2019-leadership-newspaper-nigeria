We are poised to ensure that issues that relate to electricity consumption are routinely looked into to minimize dissatisfaction or complaints” “The restructuring is a continuum and we are going to invest heavily in that regard provided our customers will also continue to support KEDCO by paying their bills as partners in progress” he said. Gwamna hinted that more innovations would be witnessed from KEDCO that would excite customers in all its franchise areas in terms of improved network and better service delivery. He, however, called on customers to see KEDCO as one big project that holds the key to the development of the economy of Northern Nigeria, hence the need to assist in whatever way possible to see to the progress of the project.
