The Plateau Government on Saturday urged parents and guardians to ensure that all children below the age of five are immunised against the polio disease in the ongoing National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDs). Mrs Jerisha Kakwi, State Health Educator, Primary Health Care (PHC) Board, gave the advice during a meeting with the Rapid Respond Team/Task Force Committee, Jos North Local Government. Kakwi, said the aim of the four-day NIPDs exercise, which kicked off July 20, to end July 23 and being conducted across the 17 LGAs of the state, was to ensure that no eligible child is left unimmunised in the state. “As members of the task force committee, you must ensure that no child is left unimmunised in Jos North LGA. “You are aware that the state government is more concerned about Jos North Local Government Area where we have been recording non-compliance. Therefore, we must be serious about the exercise. “We should ensure that immunisation teams visit even motor parks and all nooks and crannies of communities to ensure eligible children are immunised, ‘’ she said. Also speaking at the meeting, Mrs Rebeca Nimlan, Jos North PHC Director, said, “only through team work, determination and commitment, we shall be able to succeed this time around’’. Nimlan pledged to ensure that the feedback mechanism was implemented to the letter to ensure that no child was left without taking the polio vaccine. Mr Sikiru Bello, Chairman, Rapid Respond Team/Task Force Committee, who chaired the meeting, pledged the committee’s commitment toward the four-day NIPDs programme for its success for “the survival and better health for our children’’. Bello described the meeting as “very timely’’ and “encouraging’’ and expressed the hope that parents in Jos would this time around, cooperate with the health officials for total compliance and success.
