As the House of Representatives reconvenes tomorrow, there is intense lobbying for who emerges the Majority Leader, LEADERSHIP has gathered. It was learnt that while some members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) are favourably disposed to Aminu Sulaiman, others are queuing behind the candidature of Ado Doguwa as the preferred candidate for leader of the House of Representatives. Sulaiman, a third termer in the House, who was Kano State secretary of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), represents Fagge Federal Constituency and was the chairman, House committee on Tertiary Education in the 8th Assembly. LEADERSHIP also gathered that the NWC had earlier settled for Doguwa based on his pedigree as a fifth termer and a staunch supporter of Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, who served as the Chief Whip of the House of Representatives in the 8th Assembly. Sources close to the Kano State government said it is mobilising for Doguwa over the choice of Sulaiman as the House Leader. According to these sources, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje would storm the National Secretariat of the party later, today, with no fewer than 19 of the 24 House of Representatives members from the state to present their position in support of Doguwa. “The APC chairman is favourably disposed to Sulaiman on the House Leader issue simply because they worked together before in the NLC as comrades. “There is a difference between the NLC and party politics. This position was zoned to Kano and the stakeholders in Kano have made up their minds on who they want to occupy the position. Doguwa is not new to the Gbajabiamila camp. “They were together in the struggle in 2015 and in 2019. He has paid his dues. He remains the most experienced lawmaker best suited for the job as far as we are concerned,” a source who prefers anonymity said.
