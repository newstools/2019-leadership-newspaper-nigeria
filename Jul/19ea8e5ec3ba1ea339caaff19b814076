Speaking, Monday, during Lagos state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu’ meeting with traditional rulers in Lagos, Akiolu said Tinubu knows it that he is not a rubber stamp to any political big wig.

He told Sanwo-Olu and his deputy, Dr Obafemi Hamzat not to accede to his request if he makes unworthy requests from them. Akiolu advised Sanwo-Olu and his deputy to be fast to listen to people’s words, information and advice, but be slow to respond. According to him, many who will come to advise them are hypocrites who give the world account of the discussions they had, when they came visiting.

He said the visit was to felicitate with the governor on his success at the polls and bring greetings from the kingdoms the traditional rulers administer. Oba Akiolu promised that the kings and their chiefs would work with the governor to ensure that his administration is a success The governor thanked the traditional rulers for coming promising to foster a good working relationship with the traditional institutions for Lagos to be safe and destination of choice for investment.
